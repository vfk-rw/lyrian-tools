strategy: |
  The crystal behemoth automatically reacts with Crystal Barrier when targeted with an attack if it can.
  If it can use Crystal Burst, it will. Otherwise, it will use Crystal Stomp.
  If it's close to an enemy, it will use Rock Crunching Bite and a mix of Light and Heavy attacks.
  If it struggles to reach an enemy, it will instead use Astra Beams spending all its AP on it.
  If it identifies a silver weapon threat, it will try to focus that enemy.

running_the_monster: |
  The crystal behemoth is a suitable threat to a party. It can be defeated in two ways, either by
  draining its mana to 0 by letting it use crystal burst or by defeating it the normal way.
  The crystal burst way ensures even parties without magic users can defeat it, though they it will
  most likely not be a great fight for them.
  Note that it will not drop a core if it kills itself with crystal burst.
