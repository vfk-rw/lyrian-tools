  description: 'Martial Artists are fighters who’ve turned their bodies into finely
    tuned weapons. All across the world of Lyr, you can find them practicing different
    arts and styles. The true might of the Martial Artist is their mastery of Zaipher,
    the skill of tapping into their internal mana to heal themselves and deal devastating
    magic-enhanced blows.

    Zaipher doesn''t have the raw power of Arcane magic, but what it lacks in volume,
    it makes up for in blazing speed. Martial Artists utilize  quick, sudden bursts
    of energy that can take an enemy by surprise.'
  guide: 'Martial Artists are strikers with a simple standard combo. Leg Sweep is
    the combo starter. Being knocked prone is already bad normally, but especially
    so against a martial artist. You should expect most enemies to attempt to react
    to a leg sweep. If they don''t, or if you hit anyway, you can follow up with a
    Rushing Knee Drop.

    Rushing Knee Drop is guaranteed to hit and can be used with both AP and RP. The
    RP version is less efficient, but it can allow for a higher damage turn. Rushing
    Knee Drop can also be used when its not your turn, if an ally is able to render
    an opponent Prone. Because this is not on your turn, this version always costs
    an RP and can''t be used with just an AP.

    The final part of the combo is Double Punch. This ability is good even by itself,
    paying 1 mana for an extra light attack. The mana cost does mean you can''t simply
    use it every turn, but it''s low enough that you should consider it on most turns.

    Their single non-damaging combat ability is Vital Drive. Vital Drive isn''t very
    mana efficient, but it takes no action and you can potentially spend a lot of
    mana on it to heal for a large amount.

    Unarmed abilities only require a single free hand, so keeping an utility item
    in your offhand for quick use is possible.'
