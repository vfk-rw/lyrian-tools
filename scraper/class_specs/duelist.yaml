  description: The Duelist is a highly skilled fighter who excels in one-on-one combat.
    They are agile and quick on their feet, using their speed and finesse to outmaneuver
    their opponents and deliver precise, deadly strikes.
  guide: 'The duelist, like the fencer it builds on, is a 1v1 expert and off-tank
    on the battlefield. With deflect missiles, they gain some defense against ranged
    attacks.

    Riposte II is a more defensive version of the original riposte. Where the fencer
    traded the RP they saved from the Parry ability into damage, with Riposte II the
    duelist can dish out heavy attacks while sitting on all their RP still. It does
    cost mana, so it''s nothing something that should be used after every Parry.

    Duelist Blow is a powerful tool in 1v1s, but since the benefit disappears when
    forced to use RP against other targets it may be hard to use in fights against
    multiple enemies unless you can find isolated those 1v1s.

    Forward Momentum is a simple and cheap ability that helps with that. It''s best
    used with light attacks if the target still has RP remaining. A few attacks and
    the duelist can fight the target without interruptions.

    The Climax Art: Endless Waltz has the potential for a ton of attacks. It''s especially
    strong against enemies out of RP, against who it may repeat until they are dead.
    Against grunts, it can still be powerful although less consistent. The first attack
    would remove their RP, while the second would deal damage. Of course, bad rolls
    can happen and the ability may end early.'
