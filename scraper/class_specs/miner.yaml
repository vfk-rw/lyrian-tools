  description: 'The advent of the Adventurer and the use of internal magic began an
    age of heroes. Of feats great and small immortalized in legends and small tavern
    tales. But quietly, beyond the glory of heroes, the same power that let them set
    their names ablaze in history gave rise to something more modest. The crunch of
    a shovel slicing into the ground or the ring of the pickaxe against stone were
    not the sounds of heroes, but to the humble Miner, they represented greatness.

    Utilizing their own internal mana to augment their strength and precision, individual
    Miners were able to gather on a scale that used to take teams of a dozen or more
    to match. Be it stone for roads and castle walls or rare metals to be forged into
    legendary weapons, Miners represented the bedrock of architects and smiths the
    world over. While Mining Guilds obviously emerged to organize and regulate rich
    mining opportunities, solitary Miners were still common in villages and the frontiers
    of society. A single Miner with an abundant area to gather from could easily support
    an entire town’s needs for stone and metal.

    And while it was common for Miners to have hired protectors, especially within
    the guilds, it was a foolish attacker that believed them to be easy targets. That
    same power and precision that allowed a Miner to shatter rock with ease and peel
    raw ore from the earth was just as easily turned toward their defense. It was
    a foolish bandit or adventurer that underestimated the rending power of a Miner’s
    pickaxe.'
  guide: 'Miner is a gatherer and striker class that functions like an anti-tank character
    in combat. Rock Fang reduces the target''s guard by 2, which can be massive boost
    in damage even against non-tanks. Especially if you have allies that are dual
    wielding. It''s best used against elites, as grunts will most likely die too fast
    for the debuff to matter.

    Excavation Crash is best used when an enemy is surrounded by your allies. The
    enemy may choose to move to avoid your Heavy attack, but doing so DOES provoke
    attacks of opportunity from your allies which might result in it taking even more
    damage.

    For gathering, Power Rock Strike is a great opener especially once you get more
    points in mining. Efficient strike can be to ensure you don''t waste any points
    on your node point total and can get the maximum lucky value. It''s best to use
    this as late as possible, in case you still need to use abilities that may drain
    your node points.'
