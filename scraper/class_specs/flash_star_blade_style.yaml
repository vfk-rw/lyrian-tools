  guide: 'The Flash Star Style is a sword style originating from the Raijin that requires
    precise positioning. Photon Line moves you exactly 25ft, not up to 25ft. This
    can make it difficult to use against a single target, since you''ll often dash
    past the target and be unable to attack them without moving. Using it as a retreating
    option is a valid choice as you force the enemy to move to attack you.

    If you do manage to line up the perfect Photon Line on the offense, you can combo
    it into Thunderbolt Slash. Thunderbolt Slash is 3 light attacks for the cost of
    2 AP. With its mana cost reduced by the combo effect, it lines up perfectly for
    a 4 AP turn that doesn''t cost any mana.

    Starlight Crescent Reversal is a safe mana dump each turn, allowing for a cheap
    Light attack.

    The Secret Art: Twin Nova Pursuit is an engagement and isolation tool. You are
    able to move a target 25ft or 50ft, depending on how they react, which can let
    you get a 1v1 when you remove an enemy from a melee brawl. It can also be used
    to engage and knock an enemy into your own allies, allowing them to pile on without
    having to move and most likely dragging that enemy out of range of any support
    abilities.'
