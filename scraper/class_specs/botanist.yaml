  description: 'The frigid passes surrounding Mt. Merlin were inhospitable places.
    Cutting winds, icy ground, and regular blizzards made them nearly impassable during
    the winter months, not that dangerous conditions stopped the adventurous from
    making the trek into the mountains. Small villages populated by hardy men and
    women were scattered through the passes and valleys. And each had their share
    of myths and legends passed down through the years. For the village of Cartrmyn,
    the Princess of the Mountain was theirs.

    As the story was told, the Princess of the Mountain influenced the chill, the
    snow, and the storms of the little valley Cartrmyn was nestled in. Said to have
    the form of a “woman made of ice”, offerings were left regularly at the beginning
    and end of winter. A common game among the children of the village was to stay
    up into the deep night in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the Princess as she
    collected the offerings. Gifts of wild berries, mosses, lichens, mushrooms of
    all kinds, stacks of wood from unknown trees, and unheard of herbs would be given
    by the Princess in thanks. And the types of gifts exchanged would tell the villagers
    how the winter would go or…as an apology for a harsh season. When piles of berries
    and nuts and extra firewood was left, the village knew they were in for a dangerous
    winter; but gifts of wild flowers and herbs told of a mild winter approaching.
    By heeding the signs left by the Princess, Cartrmyn was able to thrive in even
    the most extreme seasons.

    However, it wasn’t long before word spread about their guardian Princess and those
    seeking riches and knowledge would come in search of her. For those who were respectful
    of the village and of the mountain, they would leave with wisdom and the grace
    of the Princess and would forever find safe passage in the winter chill. But for
    those with greed in eyes and evil in their hearts, the Princess was as unforgiving
    as a sudden winter storm. The unearthly shrieks of those that crossed her echoed
    across the mountain side like the roars of a hundred mountain lions and the gnashing
    of a thousand teeth, a dire warning to all that would cross--

    Miyu closed the book with a sharp snap and sighed. “It was just a chainsaw,” she
    complained to no one. “And why do they make it sound like I’m hundreds of years
    old?!” Grudgingly, she tucked the book back into the pack that had been prepared
    by the villagers. Dried meats and fish, metal tools and knives, and a small collection
    of glowing crystals that she could use to produce more magical fuels. In return,
    she had laid out hand woven baskets of whatever she’d been able to find over the
    last week that she wasn’t keeping for herself. Berries, tubers, and bundles of
    medicinal flowers.

    “Why is it so hard to get people to leave me alone?”'
  guide: 'The botanist, like the forager, is a gathering and utility class. Their
    only in combat ability is Felling Strike. At first glance it may look like a normal
    knockback move, but you get to move before doing the knockback, which lets you
    more easily do things like push enemies of ledges or knock an enemy back into
    your team.

    Craft Pemmican lets you convert food units into rations without the cost of any
    actions. These rations are easier to carry, don''t require a kit to prepare and
    less likely to be ruined. It''s a nice little bonus and there''s little reason
    not to do it whenever you can.

    During gathering, Memory of the Grove synergizes with the forager abilities as
    well as the other botanist ability, Stalks of Comparison. Memory can be used in
    several ways, you can reroll a very low dice to get a better roll, but you can
    also use it on a higher value one to store it for later use with Stalks or Divining
    Petalfall.

    For stalks of comparison, it''s always a good ability since it can apply to either
    Node points or Lucky points. Getting the bonus for it can be made easier or even
    guaranteed with the use of other abilities. Using the stored value of memory along
    with the pre-determined rolls of Verdant Instinct can get you that bonus.'
