  description: Chronofighter is a melee-focused class that uses time power to enhance
    their attacks.
  guide: 'Chronofighter is a complex class that relies in setting up future turns
    to take advantage of attacks from the past.

    Attacks from the past is a difficult ability to use. Because everything is exactly
    mirrored based of the position of your previous turn and you cannot move before
    using it, it comes down to planning and a bit of luck to make good use of. However,
    when it does, the result is amazing. Being able to double your attacks are almost
    no cost is incredibly powerful.

    Accelerating Strike is a tool that should be combined with the Delay encounter
    start action, which is free for a Chronofighter. This lets you loop enemies at
    a crucial point, letting you take two turns in a row before they can respond.

    Delayed Hit is a good tool getting around temporary guard buffs. The target can
    still Block the damage when it hits the turn later, but less intelligent creatures
    may get faked out by the weird nature of the attack and try to react to it from
    the start.

    Butterfly Effect is a ramping ability. The initial mana cost is extremely high
    and it is not until the third use that it becomes a good use. The total mana cost
    before it becomes free is 9 mana and it takes at least 3 turns of stacking. Keep
    this in mind before using it, as it is a heavy commitment and a big waste of mana
    if you can''t get max value out of it. When a fight does last long though and
    you get to keep stacking it, it is one of the most powerful abilities that exists.'
