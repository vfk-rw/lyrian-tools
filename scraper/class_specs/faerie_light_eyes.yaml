      description: Must have the “Mystic Eyes of Faerie Light” breakthrough.
  description: The Fae have natural abilities to twist reality into wild illusions.  All
    Fae have their eyes naturally linked to their Spirit Circuits, allowing them to
    peer through natural veils that cause other beings to become lost in deep forests.  A
    few Fae have trained these connections further, causing them to unleash reality-warping
    abilities that affect the minds of their opponents.  Faerie Light Eyes also increases
    kinetic perception, allowing the user to more easily dodge attacks from enemies.
  guide: 'Users are of the Faerie Light eyes are masters of illusion and deadly against
    those without an heroic aura. Hold Person instantly reduces their AP and RP to
    0, at the cost of one of your own RP. Because it''s an RP ability, it can be used
    as reaction to what a grunt is doing. Save it for one that is doing something
    important, such as tossing a flask or trying to escape and alert others. There''s
    not much reason to use this on your own turn, unless you want to follow it up
    with Empty.

    Empty renders a person under the effects of Hold Person insane, which may not
    always be a desirable outcome. Even disregarding interrogations, an insane person
    could run further into a dungeon and alert others. Even when not used for this
    purpose, Empty can be a powerful ability. Many monsters do not have many abilities,
    and a single save is all that stands between them and losing a core ability permanently
    for the rest of the fight.

    If you manage to seal away a powerful ability, you can use it yourself with Golden
    Illusion. Copying the ability is free, so there is little reason not to do it.
    You can simply replace it if you get a better ability later in the fight. How
    to use the golden illusion the best is hard to say, it all depends on what you
    copy after all.

    Time Dilation is an improved dodge. The mana cost is a bit steep, but you can
    use it after you see the roll and thus perfectly determine how much mana you need
    to use to dodge the attack.'
