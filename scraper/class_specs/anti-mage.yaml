  description: 'Anti-mage is a discipline often pursued by those who don''t practice
    magic themselves. With Mages playing such a critical role in boosting military
    power, it''s often a top priority to neutralize them first. Thatâ€™s where Anti-Mages
    come in. They dedicate their studies to finding the cracks in all forms of magic,
    learning how to disrupt and cancel its effects.

    Anti-Mages have a deep understanding of magic, perhaps even more so than some
    Mages themselves. They don''t just know how magic works, they know how to break
    it.

    A prime example of their power was seen during the 2nd Battle of Jav. A Demon
    Anti-Mage singlehandedly turned the tide at the east gate, neutralizing a line
    of magical smoke deployed by the Westrians. This critical move helped maintain
    the stalemate that Jav held for years, showcasing just how formidable Anti-Mages
    can be on the battlefield.'
  guide: 'Anti-mages do well against mages as the name suggests. Dispel magic is a
    guaranteed removal of a magical effect that has many possible uses. Whether its
    buffs, control spells or debuffs, dispel magic can remove it all.

    If you know you''re up against a mage that can shield themselves or allies, you
    can cast Anti-Shield on them. For many mages, shields are an important defense
    and Anti-Shield can be safely re-applied to them every turn to deny them this.

    If your allies are under fire by enemy mages, you can use Anti-Magic Shield on
    them. It gives them 1 RP and reduces the damage they take on top of that.

    Counterspell can be gamechanging if used to counter an important spell. Though
    it has high potential, it also has a high RP cost. If you try to counterspell
    simple damage spells, you''ll quickly find yourself running out. Save your RP
    and only use it to deny a spell the opposing mage absolutely needs to cast.'
