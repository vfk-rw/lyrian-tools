  description: 'Legends have it that Fayto Zhelti was the first true adventurer, a
    spirited young girl from a humble town in the Kingdom of Alpinum.  Her Father
    was an explorer and Fayto dreamed of following in his footsteps.

    Yet, as childhood began to fade away, a painful realization crawled within her
    heart:  the incredibly physical feats of strength her father effortlessly performed
    always lay just beyond grasp.  No amount of blood, sweat or tears could overcome
    the anguish of her physical reality.  She watched her younger brothers surpass
    her in strength, joining their father on this expeditions she yearned for.  Loneliness
    began to infect her heart that ached for adventure, but fate had cruelly denied
    her that path.

    Still she persisted, even in her pain... tirelessly striking the same tree day
    after day for years.

    Humans barely had the lifespan to master the arcane arts—which at the time were
    incredibly complex without shortcuts.  Her Mother, an arcane practitioner, taught
    her daughter the methods of utilizing magic for mundane tasks:  heating water
    kettles and stirring up a gentle whirlpool to do laundry.  While practicing these
    humble homecrafts, Fayto remembered that feeling, the tingling surge that ran
    through her limbs.

    One day, as she swung her dulled blade against that ancient tree, she poured every
    ounce of her yearning and willpower into her strike.  The familiar surge ran through
    her as the explosive energy flooded her body, exactly as it had done alongside
    her Mother.  In a thunderous crash, the mighty tree toppled.

    From that day forward, she pursued that elusive feeling.  She trained relentlessly
    until she mastered the art of "internal magic" which would be known later as ki.
     Soon after that she joined her father''s adventures at last, growing and developing
    until she embarked on her own journeys, making a name for herself wherever she
    went "Fayto, the female adventurer."

    To this day, adventurers still practice the skills Fayto Zhelti perfected long
    ago—a martial art born of determination and control of ones self, leveling the
    playing field for all who practice it.  Following Fayto''s example, Adventurers
    continue to train—leaping to extraordinary heights, molding mana to extend their
    reach, projecting their aura like iron... all while maintaining perfect composure.
      Although the ancient martial art remains nameless, its teaches are diligently
    passed down to every aspiring adventurer, serving as a solid foundation for future
    development.'
  guide: 'The adventurer is a generalist class that has a bit of everything. One of
    the main draws of the adventurer is their options in picking their proficiencies,
    being the only tier 1 class that can choose a specialized weapon and heavy armor.

    Power Jump is an anti-air tool that lets you hit enemies in the air even if you
    only have melee weapons. It is even better if you can fly, as you can use power
    jump as a cheap way to gain altitude.

    Mana Razor gives you increased range on your attacks. If you''re using a melee
    weapon with this, you''ll need to be aware that turning your attacks into ranged
    attacks does mean you''ll provoke attacks of opportunity. It may also disable
    the use of abilities with a range of “Melee Weapon Range”

    Steel Aura is a defensive tool that can be very powerful when attacked by a large
    group of grunts. With 3 additional guard, you will most likely take only 1 damage
    from light attacks from those enemies, though you''ll still need to be wary of
    heavy attacks.

    Your Secret Art: Efficient Spirit Control is a simple mana reduction ability.
    If you do not have any other secret arts yet, then don''t be afraid to use this
    whenever you would spend 2 or more mana on something.'
