  description: 'Artificers were the great equalizers of the world.  In a land where
    magic was steeped into the fiber of every being, those who failed to understand
    its mysteries suffered a steep disadvantage.  During the Great Divine War where
    magic razed the land and powerful Divine Arms leveled cities, the desperation
    of the weak created the first artifices—artificial spirit circuits that used magical
    fuel to function.  This allowed even the magically inept, but studied warriors
    to brave the battlefield against the hellscape of fireballs and magic missiles.
     Contained in compact shells, magical fuel was compressed into an easy to use
    form and inserted into the artifice which allowed devastating spell effects to
    ignite at the press of a button.

    After the war, Artificers brought comfort and convenience to the world... filling
    the night streets with an easy to maintain source of light that didn''t rely on
    dangerous gasses or fuels.  Their devices fed the world through agricultural technology
    and brought nations together with fleets of wondrous airships that brought trade
    and culture from far away lands.

    To this day, Artificers are a staple in society... and some still take on the
    pioneering spirit of their ancestors, creating new wondrous tools for the future
    of the realm.'
  guide: 'The artificer is an artisan class that functions as a utility class outside
    of crafting.

    Your Blackbird is a very powerful scouting device, able to scout long distances
    at little cost. Unlike most other forms of scouting, the blackbird carries little
    risk even if its discovered only requiring an errand action to repair. Another
    errand action you have is repair artifice, which can be more useful than other
    repair skills thanks to Overclock. Overclock might give you that little bit of
    crafting boost that you need, at the cost of making the item start broken. It
    doesn''t cost a crafting dice, you so don''t need to use it unless the craft would
    otherwise fail.

    Your final ability is Quick Artifice Reload. While weak when you start out, the
    more artifices you get the more use you''ll get out of this as it allows you to
    use powerful artifices more than once per combat without having to spend a lot
    of AP reloading.'
