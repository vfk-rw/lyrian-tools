  guide: 'Monks are dodge experts with some access to ranged attacks. Ki Blast is
    a simple ranged attack, being notable for its ability to be used without a weapon
    and for dealing arcane damage. Many martial artists lack ways to deal non-physical
    damage and Ki Blast is a good option against enemies that are strong against physical
    damage.

    Flowing Kick becomes an AP efficient move if used after an attack misses. If you
    missed an attack previously, there''s little reason not to follow it with a Flowing
    Kick.

    Serene Water Stance is the core of the monk. Entering it isn''t very hard, but
    making full use of it isn''t easy. It gives you some extra evasion, but you cannot
    move normally while in this stance. This means you have little to catch up to
    an enemy and forced to spam Ki Blast instead. Because of the mana cost, you also
    have to make a conscious choice whether to enter it or not.

    If you do enter the stance and are able to stay in range of the enemy, you can
    use Strike of Still Water. With a Sure Hit and Full pierce attack for just 1 mana,
    it is incredibly powerful. If you are able to use it, do so.'
