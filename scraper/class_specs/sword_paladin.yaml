  description: Paladins are powerful warriors who receive their powers from their
    god. Sword paladins are fearless juggernauts from whom escape is nearly impossible.
  guide: 'The sword paladin is the more aggressive counterpart of the shield paladin.

    They specialize in hunting down their enemies by limiting their escape options.
    Mark of Justice slows down an enemy to the same level as a basic human. Very useful
    against Fae, Cats and rogue-ish characters. It also opens an enemy up to other
    abilities.

    Justice Blade can only be used against an enemy marked by Mark of Justice. It
    trades 1 AP cost in 1 for mana, which is a fair trade.

    When an enemy is low enough, Divine Smite can finish them off automatically dealing
    max damage with full pierce. If the enemy is not low enough, this ability still
    gets used but without the extra benefits so be aware of that. The enemy can also
    still dodge it, but it''s good for finishing grunt type enemies.'
