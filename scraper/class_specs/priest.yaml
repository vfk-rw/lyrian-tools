  guide: 'The priest has access to several healing and support abilities.

    Holy Light is a heal that doesn''t heal as much as Cure Touch does, but it costs
    less AP and most importantly, has greatly increased range. Where the acolyte has
    to play close to their allies and is at risk of provoking attacks of opportunity
    to heal, the priest doesn''t have that issue. Out of combat, Cure Touch is still
    better for healing.

    The Secret Art: Resurrect is an emergency heal that can only be used when an ally
    has already gone down. Note how it sets the targets HP to 0 before healing. This
    makes it have great synergy with demons or other abilities that allow a person
    to fight at full strength when below 0 HP. They can keep going until they reach
    heavy negative HP before they go down, after which you can bring them back up.

    Sacrament is a free buff that you will most likely want to apply to your strongest
    physical striker at the start of combat. Turning the weapon into holy damage can
    also be very helpful against certain enemies.

    Anathema is powerful debuff that lets your allies to greatly increased damage
    for 1 hit. It relies on a save instead of an attack roll, making it good against
    dodgy enemies, but less effective against enemies with high toughness. Because
    all the damage is added up, it can be good against high armor enemies if you manage
    to land it, but most high guard enemies will also have high toughness. It also
    has a noticeable mana cost, so be mindful of how much you use it.'
