  guide: 'The deadeye is a ranged striker with some minor control and utility. Status
    Assessment III is similar to the previous version, but it no longer has the quick
    keyword meaning it can be used without worrying that it increases the cost of
    other abilities.

    Aimed Shot is a simple attack meant to punish enemies that rely on dodge.

    Disarming Shot is a powerful tool that can be used to disarm enemies for a long
    range. Disarming melee enemies may seem like the obvious choice, but many ranged
    enemies will not carry a spare ranged weapon. Disarming them will most likely
    lead to them being unable to act for the turn.

    Countershot is another tool the Deadeye has to show it is the superior ranged
    attacker. It is not guaranteed, but it can assist allies and defend yourself against
    opposing ranged attacks.

    Secret Art: Perfect Repetition is not the easiest secret art to use. It has the
    upside of having no mana cost and relatively low AP cost, but if you roll badly
    the attack is wasted. On the other hand, a good roll almost ensures a guaranteed
    hit every round unless the target takes cover. It is more reliable when the enemy
    has no RP, but don''t be afraid to throw it out early and go for a gamble. It''s
    worth the risk.'
