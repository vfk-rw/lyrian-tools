  guide: 'Great Berserker are high risk, offensive powerhouses.

    Single-Minded Fury makes them focus on that 1 person, gaining a ton of bonuses
    and immunities, but being effectively useless against other enemies until that
    target is dead. Using it early or against the wrong target can make you ineffective
    in the fight. For example, a flying enemy may be unreachable for several turns
    in which you''d be able to do little.

    Simply running away is not much of an option however. Unrelenting assault prevents
    them from escaping through any means other than teleporting.

    Smash through the pain gives great berserkers a bit of survivability, though at
    the cost of using that RP to do more damage. It''s pretty efficient and it stacks
    with your normal guard bonus.

    Victory or Death is a double-edged sword. Doing maximum damage is obviously good,
    but if you fail to finish off the enemy or enemies, then you will take a ton of
    damage on the turn after. It is best used when needing to finish off a high priority
    target or near the end of a fight. Because of the difference in damage rolls sizes,
    it is best used solely with heavy attacks. There''s little benefit to maximum
    damage light attacks in most cases.'
