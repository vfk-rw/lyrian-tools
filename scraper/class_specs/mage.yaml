  description: 'Mages are initiates of the arcane, whoâ€™ve mastered the basics and
    proven their skill in both control and power. By drawing in ambient mana and blending
    it with their own, they can cast devastating spells of all kinds. The path of
    a Mage is as varied as the Mages themselves.

    Some might start off their journey at the Merlin''s Academy of Magic, while others
    are self taught or might become the pupil of a wandering teacher.

    While still considered beginners in the journey of Magic, Mages are quite powerful
    on their own with many considering a skilled mage to be worth the equivalent of
    an entire squad of infantry.'
  guide: 'Mages offer supportive control to the party, out of combat utility and a
    barrage of long range spells to wither down the most evasive of targets.

    Sense Magic and Decipher Magic both serve as out of combat investigation tools.
    Sense Magic gives information, while Decipher Magic actively lets you disable
    magical fields.

    Arcane Barrier is a defensive tool that lets mages effectively block without having
    a high guard. If an attack did a low amount of damage, you may be able to use
    the Block reaction afterwards with the barrier still up and still get some value
    out of it.

    Glittershards is their control ability. It covers a 15x15ft area which is a decent
    area and be can be used primarily to block enemy ranged attackers from shooting
    you. The mana cost on it is low, so you can feel free to drop it and recast it
    in a better position if the need arises.

    Magic Missile is light attack that should be used against dodge heavy characters.
    If you know the enemy is not going to die from 1 missile, you can overcharge it
    and fire a second one for the same cost again. The target has to react to both
    of them with separate reactions, so you''ll be doing some good damage or burning
    reactions with it.'
