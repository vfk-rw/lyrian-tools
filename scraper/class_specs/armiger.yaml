  description: 'Armigers are those who follow a lesser-known path of the Wandering
    Witch, Chroma-Daria Lichtvog—a discipline cloaked in the folds of space rather
    than time. They are said to draw upon hidden realms between the mortal world and
    the heavens, forging tiny pockets of reality where their relics lie waiting. While
    others try to replicate this inter-dimensional craft through mere artificing,
    the mimicry cannot begin to understand the true nature of the world beyond the
    veil.

    Stories speak of Armigers phantom thieves, making valuables disappear in the blink
    of an eye with sleight of hand. But in reality they carve out their vault in the
    emptiness between planes, shaping that space with will and technique. To the untrained
    eye, an Armiger seems to summon weapons out of thin air—one moment, their hands
    are empty; the next, they brandish whatever blade suits the situation. Scholars
    debate whether these conjurations come from raw sorcery or from the Witch’s ancient
    teachings, locked away in scrolls that vanish just as quickly as the vaults themselves.

    Facing an Armiger in combat can be jarring, for they never truly run out of options.
    One weapon broken, another materializes. An opponent thinks them cornered—yet
    the Armiger draws forth an entire arsenal from nowhere, their weapons gleaming
    in starlight and swirling dust. In a single, fluid motion, they swap armaments
    as easily as drawing a breath.  An attack with a mace to break armor could suddenly
    become the pointed tip of a spear—a confusing dance that keeps opponents constantly
    on the defensive.

    The best among them often walk unarmed with a calm confidence, knowing that whatever
    threat appears, they carry an arsenal in the blink of an eye. And though some
    see the Armigers’ ability as merely convenient, rumors persist of deeper secrets
    hidden in those dimensional pockets. For Armigers, it’s not just about storing
    trinkets—it’s about understanding the distance between worlds, that tenuous thread
    of reality and emptiness. No Armiger is ever truly disarmed—and perhaps thats
    what makes them fearsome.'
  guide: 'An armiger''s primary strength in combat lies in their versatility through
    the items stored in their Dimensional Armory. As such, the most difficult part
    of being an Armiger comes before the battle starts in how you fill it up.

    The dimensional armory gives a lot of extra burden you can work with, allowing
    you to retrieve them quickly through Fast Dimensional Equip. This does cost either
    mana or RP, both valuable combat resources. Using it with RP allows you to change
    the weapon midattack, giving you options such as changing to a different damage
    type or swapping to a katana for the extra crit. The 0 AP swap can also be helpful
    in letting you alternate between melee and ranged combat without losing any AP.

    With Full Dimensional Equip, you can change your armor easily alongside your weapon.
    This gives an Armiger an unusual advantage in being able to swap their armor to
    fit the situation, where normal people are stuck with their choice even if it''s
    less optimal.

    Armiger''s out of combat utility comes from Send To Armory. The armory can hold
    any sort of item, allowing you to steal or hide things with no risk of what you
    took ever being found. It has little use in combat, though if an enemy ever drops
    a weapon to switch to a different one, you can ensure they can''t pick it back
    up.'
