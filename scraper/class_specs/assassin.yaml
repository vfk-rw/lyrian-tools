  description: 'Assassins trace their origins back to the lawless city of Telsin,
    deep in the Southern Desert. With little military power of their own and relying
    mostly on the harsh desert environment for protection, the people of Telsin developed
    less conventional methods of defense. Assassins emerged from this need, honing
    their skills in reconnaissance and studying their targets with meticulous care,
    mentally preparing themselves before executing the perfect kill.

    Their reputation for precision and effectiveness quickly spread, becoming so legendary
    that other nations started to take notice. Before long, these nations began hiring
    assassins of their own, both to eliminate key targets and to counter the deadly
    expertise of other assassins.'
  guide: 'The assassin functions best when they get the jump on the enemy. Their Inconspicuous
    key ability is key for this, as it lets them get a surprise attack even if the
    rest of the party isn''t quite as sneaky.

    When they get the surprise, they can use their Death Mark ability. It gives them
    a small benefit on killing the target, but the real use is opening up the target
    to their other abilities.

    Devastating Strike IV is the first of those abilities. Similar to the normal devastating
    strike, but it does guaranteed maximum damage.

    Their Secret Art: Assassinate is the second of those abilities. While a sure-hit
    and full pierce heavy attack is already strong by itself, it shows its true potential
    against enemies who are unaware of you. Due to this nature, it is a rare secret
    art ability that must be activated in the first round or lose power.

    Study Target has minor issues in a direct fight, though getting a lock-on heavy
    attack for 4 combined AP is not bad against dodgy enemies. When there''s a temporary
    lull in the action, for example through an acolyte sanctuary barrier, setting
    up a study target before hand will give you an edge when the fighting resumes.
    It can also be used to force a Death Mark onto an enemy if you were unable to
    get the surprise round before. However, this is very AP inefficient so it should
    most likely be avoided in most cases.'
