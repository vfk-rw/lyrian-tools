  description: Warding Mages focus on creating bounded fields that ward off intruders.
  guide: 'The warding mage is a utility class that relies on setting up defensive
    barriers. It is unsuited for many normal campaigns, due to the long casting time
    and only working when enemies come to you. In a campaign focused more around intrigue
    or where action takes place around a single place, they can provide peace of mind
    and creates a zone where enemies will struggle to fight in.

    Maintaining bounded fields reduces your maximum mana, but they last forever. Maintain
    the ones you need to and cancel fields once they have exhausted their use.

    Alarm Ward is the first field you get. It simply warns you (and others) when someone
    unwanted enters it. Many vaults, treasure rooms or other rooms containing important
    goodds or information will contain some form of an Alarm Ward.

    Explosive Ward is your second available field. It is usually placed on containers
    containing papers with sensitive information on it. If anybody tries to steal
    it, the papers will be destroyed even if the thief manages to get away.

    Sapping Ward is your final ward and one that greatly reduces the combat potential
    of any enemies entering it. The weakened condition is already bad enough, but
    grunts become stunned as well. Because a stunned target has no AP or RP, they
    will never be able to escape the ward while it lasts, essentially permanently
    disabling them for the encounter.

    Through hidden wards, you are able to hide your fields. With Disable Magic, you
    are able to disable other fields making Warding Mages good for infiltration as
    well.'
