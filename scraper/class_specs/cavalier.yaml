  description: 'The origin of mounted combat and cavalry specifically has been debated
    among historians since nomadic riders hunted game across the Axian Plains. Cavalry,
    as itâ€™s recognizably known in a more modern sense, was first organized by humans,
    utilizing their more advanced techniques of animal husbandry to domesticate and
    breed horses into mounts and beasts of burden. With their reliance on various
    animals for labor, humanity had a head start and also had a distinct need for
    increased mobility on the battlefield. With open plains and rolling hills making
    up a generous portion of their homeland, humans were at a distinct disadvantage
    in mobility to the Chimera of Northi.

    In the long conflicts before the advent of Paladins, Westrian cavalry stood as
    the only near parity force humans could deploy against Northi and Sorthen. Light
    scouts and mounted archers were the primary uses of cavalry at the time to both
    maximize the strengths of mounted soldiers and to preserve both the precious skills
    of the riders and their trained mounts. While there have been many techniques
    surrounding cavalry over the centuries, modern understanding has codified the
    most basic of elements into the art of the Cavalier.

    Today, the use of cavalry has spread to every corner of Lyr. No matter the type
    of mount, be it horse, wyvern, or even the humble dragonfly, the Cavalier lays
    the foundation for all cavalry techniques.'
  guide: 'The cavalier is a mounted combatant that excels in wide open plains. Being
    a tier 1 class, you get some proficiencies with Lance being the stand out one.
    It''s a speciality weapon that can only be used while mounted, but it''s effectively
    a polearm with a potential for increased damage. Make sure you always carry a
    backup weapon in case you are forced to fight dismounted.

    Because mounts are such an important part of the cavalier, your mount choice will
    matter a lot. A horse is the most common choice (or a pony for smaller races).
    It is the fastest land mount, but it can only move in a straight line and has
    little other special qualities. The boar is the optimal choice for smaller races,
    as it will buff their trample and make it work against medium creatures. Wolf
    is the slowest of the three, but it is not restricted to line movement and has
    a special attack it can use. For most cavaliers, the horse is the best choice
    as it will make it easier to activate your Trample.

    The core ability of the cavalier is Trample. It requires you to build up some
    speed by moving, but once you do you can trample a large amount of enemies in
    a single movement. It''s a sure hit attack that knocks enemies prone, making it
    extremely punishing if it lands. It does however have some counters to be aware
    of. First being that you can''t trample enemies that are the same size as you,
    so large enemies are unaffected. Secondly that the enemy can block your attack
    to stop it. Attempting a direct charge through the enemy tank may not work out
    very well.

    To help with hit and run attacks, you get Canter. It must be used immediately
    after attacking, but it lets you sidestep 10ft which can let you move out of range
    of the enemy. After your out of range, you can then reposition and prepare for
    another charge.

    Rider & Mount as one is a passive ability that lets you re-direct attacks to you
    instead of your mount. Mounts are not as durable as you are, so you will want
    to almost always use this. AoE attacks cannot be re-directed with this, so be
    careful of those. It also doesn''t work if you''re using a flying mount, so you''ll
    want to stick with land based ones.

    Horse Whistle is what you can use to get your mount back to you after you''re
    dismounted. This lets you use other abilities such as Faerie Flash or abilities
    from other classes to temporarily get off your mount without having to walk back
    to it.

    Spirit Jump can be used as an anti-air tool, but it can also be used to help your
    mount maneuver across difficult terrain such as cliffs or wide pits.'
