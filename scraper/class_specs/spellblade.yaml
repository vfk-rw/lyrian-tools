  guide: 'The spellblade is a melee class that relies on its versatility of its weapon
    enchantments to gain an edge in battle.

    Imbue Weapon allows you to always do damage that an enemy is weak to if you''re
    aware of it. Greater Imbue Weapon is similar, paying 1 mana cost for +1 power
    bonus. Most of the time, if you are planning to stick with 1 enchantment, you
    will want to use the Greater version. In fights where you are constantly swapping
    your enchantment, it may be more worth to stick with the normal version.

    Draw Elements is what allows the spellblade to pick whatever element they want.
    Outside of elemental damage bonuses, this is mostly relevant for Elemental Strike.

    Elemental Strike is a light attack that can apply a whole variety of effects,
    based on what your weapon is currently enchanted with. Which one of these is the
    most effective depends heavily on the situation.

    Spellstrike lets you use attack magic despite being in melee combat. It is effectively
    the same as casting a spell without provoking attacks of opportunity, but since
    it is applied through your weapon it does benefit from Greater Imbue Weapon or
    similar weapon related buffs.'
