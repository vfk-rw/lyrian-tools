  guide: 'Shieldwardens are a healing class that walk a tight line between being too
    cautious and being too confident. Those too cautious will burn through their mana
    quickly, while those who wait too long before shielding may find their allies
    already on the floor where their shields will do little to get them back up. They
    lack traditional combat healing, but make up for it with superior numbers on their
    shields.

    Power Word: Shield is their standard protection spell. You’ll want to cast it
    on your tank or the target most likely to get hit in the early rounds of combat.

    Power Word: Barrier is also an option for an early cast, but the mana cost may
    feel high if the temporary HP doesn’t get used. Since it can be cast while using
    RP, it may be better to wait until the party is targeted by AoE attacks before
    using it.

    Power Word: Reinforce is a manaless way to give your allies more shields, with
    the condition that you probably already placed shields on them beforehand. It
    also works with temporary HP not applied by you, so there’s some possible powerful
    synergies there.

    Secret Art: Lifesaver is something you’ll only use as a last resort. Unless someone
    is low on hit points, it will not provide great value for its mana cost. But if
    you combine it with the above mentioned reinforce, an ally can fight at near death
    for a long period of time.

    Recover Power makes it less likely you waste your mana by shielding yourself near
    the end of the combat, but it only works on yourself.'
