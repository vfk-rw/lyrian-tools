      description: Martial Artist mastered.
  description: Bajiquan is a martial art crafted by the Wolffolk of the Susururu Woods,
    building on the ancient techniques of Kiraran martial arts. This discipline is
    all about focusing and compacting one's own mana, over and over, until it can
    be unleashed in a single, explosive strike. The practitioners of Bajiquan move
    with a fluid grace, seamlessly blending flowing movements with sudden, devastating
    bursts of power. It's a style that turns the battlefield into a dance, a ballet
    of destruction with the Bajiquan fighter at its center.
  guide: 'Masters of the Bajiquan Style use their Zhen Jiao to take small movements
    across the battlefield and deal bonus damage. It only applies when moving directly
    towards an enemy, just dancing around them isn''t what Bajiquan is about. Before
    they can make use of this, they must first enter the Tempestuous Fire Stance.
    This stance limits what you can do and most notably disables moving without canceling
    the stance, but it does work even non-bajiquan unarmed strikes.

    Once in their stance, Double Palm Strike is the main opening move of a Bajiquan
    user. It pushes the target back up to 15ft, which sets it up for a follow up movement
    from fire stance and gives the bonus damage from Zhen Jiao.

    The highest value that can be obtained from the Zhen Jiao is a follow up with
    Tetsuzanko. With a 3 AP cost, you are able to move 15ft before using it when in
    your stance which perfectly matches the maximum pushback distance from Double
    Palm Strike. Tetsuzanko also pushes the target back again, which may lead to another
    follow up if using an ability such as fight or flight.

    The other follow up option is Elbow Uppercut. Double Palm Strike is also an unarmed
    attack, so it matches the combo requirements to let Elbow Uppercut deal its full
    pierce damage.'
