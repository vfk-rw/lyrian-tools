  guide: 'Those who practice Gunfu are able to fight well from both range as well
    as in melee due to not suffering any penalties when firing in melee combat. They
    are able to weaken the enemy from range, then go in for the kill once theyâ€™ve
    come closer.

    Slide & Shoot is their gap closer that can be used to slip past the frontline
    to target the backline. It also starts their combo and should always be followed
    up with an unarmed attack for maximum value.

    Pistol Whip is counted as an unarmed attack and is thus a natural follow up that
    now costs 0 AP. The debuff it applies will help reduce the amount of attacks you
    face.

    After that, you can finish it up with a Point Blank Shot. It is not particularly
    effective against heavy armor, but it punishes dodgy characters extremely hard.

    Their Secret Art Whirling Death is an excellent clean up tool for grunt type enemies.
    Ideally it should be used when multiple enemies are already weakened. This will
    allow for multiple activations of its Killing Blow mechanic when you finish off
    the weak enemies and can keep shooting.'
