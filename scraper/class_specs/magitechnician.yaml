      description: Artificer mastered.
  description: 'Expert Magitechnicans are the true pioneers of artificing, creating
    new inventions out of piles of metal parts and magical fuel.  The most famous
    of which is the world renown artificer only known as "Angel".  During the annual
    Magitechnician Fair held by the Riannon Institute of Alchemy in Mothergreen, a
    mysterious artifice arrived as an entry.  It was a common Buster Weapon, but it
    was the intense modifications made to its efficiency that were the awe of all
    adventurers that laid eyes upon it.  Despite winning the 1st prize at the fair,
    no one came to claim the prize... and had become known as the "Angel-Type" Buster
    Artifice—named after the pseudonym used by the crafter.

    Once an artifice only used by fighters, the Angel-Type Buster Artifice started
    to spread amongst more defensively oriented users—often placed on daggers for
    quick, practical deployment.  Despite the speculations as to Angel''s identity,
    few suspected the creator was a local from their own town. Their inability to
    discover Angel''s true identity was due to preconceived notions of who or what
    a renowned artificer should look like.

    In reality, "Angel" was one of the early members of the Angel''s Sword Guild—a
    notorious Adventurer''s guild that created trouble wherever they went.  But quietly
    hidden away in her workshop, surrounded by plush toys and scattered mechanical
    parts, Ayrara Ravness—a young Fae who appears no older than a ten-year old human
    crafts some of the most innovative artifices in Axia.  She rarely takes commissions
    from outsiders, instead preferring to work exclusively with those whom her whims
    favor.  In truth, more often than not, her workshop finds itself closed due to
    the insistence of her half-sister Elly, who continually drags her away on yet
    another adventure.'
  guide: 'The magitechnician is an artisan class like the artificer.

    Your first ability and one of your main tools is the artificer''s glove. From
    these options, sigma glove is the most commonly useful one in combat allowing
    you to use an artifice more than once per turn which can be powerful when combined
    with buster artifices. Gamma glove is a specialized glove that''s good against
    other artifice users while Delta glove is a specialized, but big boost in a skill
    of your choosing. Because it''s easy to swap, you could use it to give yourself
    a +10 bonus to stealth before a stealth mission.

    Your combat ability is your Secret Art: Entropic Magic Pulse. This EMP disables
    most temporary magic effects on top of disabling artifices. The disabling magic
    part is the main use of it, allowing you to remove effects like glittershards
    of walls whenever you want and make enemies vulnerable to your allies.

    On the crafting side, expertise study is a simple 4 expertise points. Reverse
    Polarity reverses the roll, allowing you to turn a bad roll into a good one. If
    you save it for when you roll a 1 or a 2, it can give a massive boost to your
    crafting compared to keeping the roll.'
