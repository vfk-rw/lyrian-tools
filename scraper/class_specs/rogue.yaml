  description: 'Rogues are the shadowy denizens of the underworld, using subterfuge
    and cunning to outsmart their enemies. They know how to create confusion and chaos,
    slipping in for the perfect strike when the moment is just right. A Rogue’s greatest
    strength lies in understanding their own weaknesses. They never fight fair, always
    looking to tip the scales in their favor.

    You’ll find Rogues lurking in the dark corners of Lyr’s cities, where they navigate
    the underbelly with ease. But they’re not just criminals or street-level operatives.
    Many are recruited by official agencies, prized for their abilities in gathering
    information and conducting espionage. Their unique skill set also makes them invaluable
    members of adventuring parties, where their knack for stealth and strategy can
    turn the tide in any situation.

    Rogues thrive in the shadows, always one step ahead, always ready to seize the
    advantage.'
  guide: 'Rogues are high-mobility Strikers that specialize in weaving through the
    enemy lines, finding opportune targets and attacking them for high damage.  Feint,
    Evasive Maneuver and Movement Burst allow Rogues to take advantage of battlefield
    positioning without putting themselves into too much risk.

    Feint is a cheaper disengage that only works against a single target. It competes
    with evasive maneuver for escaping an enemy''s attack range, but it has another
    upside to it. Because the target cannot make any attacks of opportunity against
    you, you could fire a ranged weapon in someone''s face without risk.

    Evasive Maneuver is both an offensive and defensive tool. It can be used as a
    reaction to an enemy attacking you in melee, which forces them to move up if they
    wish to keep attacking you. This takes an AP and may provoke attacks of opportunity
    from your allies. The AP they were about to spend on the initial attack is refunded
    however and they may choose to swap targets. As a rogue, keep this is in mind
    if you don''t have a dedicated tank in your party. It can also be used to position
    more aggressively to do a full attack turn. When used on your own turn, you don''t
    even need to spend RP for it and can just use mana instead.

    Movement burst is their last mobility tool. The mana cost is high for what it
    gives, but the ability to move 100ft in 1 AP should not be underestimated. Whether
    it''s for chasing someone or escaping, a rogue with movement burst is almost impossible
    to keep up with.

    For offense, they have Sneak Attack. It has a noticeable mana cost, but trick
    attacks cost double the RP to react to. This means that grunts generally cannot
    react to it and even heroic creatures have to make a serious decision whether
    it''s worth spending 2 RP against 1 attack.

    Finally, devastating strike is the attack that shines when someone''s RP has been
    exhausted. Easy to use against grunts, but it will take some time for it to be
    usable against heroic enemies. Still, once you can use it it''s just guaranteed,
    pure damage.'
