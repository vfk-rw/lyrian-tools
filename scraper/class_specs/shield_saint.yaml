  description: 'The sworn shieldbrother or sister of a Sword Saint. Like its twin
    saint, the Shield Saint originally hails from Kirara where it fights together
    with their chosen partner.

    The Shield Saint is trained in defensive techniques whose purpose is to allow
    for their partner to focus purely on offense while the Shield Saint absorbs the
    hits. At first these techniques were merely physical, but over time the nature
    has evolved into a more spiritual connection. The bond between a Shield Saint
    and their partner links their very souls together and neither can be bonded again
    until one of them passes away. Because of this, the partner a Shield Saint chooses
    is very important and in Kirara most pairs are selected based on compatibility
    at an early age. It is not uncommon for a Sword Saint and Shield Saint pair to
    be romantically involved with each other.'
  guide: 'As a Shield Saint, your primary goal is to protect your soulmate from harm.

    Your main tool for doing so is Faithful Shield, which lets you turn AP into free
    RP for the purpose of keeping your soulmate safe. Shelter still has a range restriction,
    so this works best if your soulmate is also a melee character.

    Quick Assist combines several feature of Bodyguard into one and adds some offense
    on top of it. Keep in mind the range is rather short and like with Faithful Shield,
    your life is easier with a melee soulmate as you are more likely to get the mana
    cost reduction.

    The secret art Dynamic Duo combines defense with offense. You Challenge all enemies
    and can use the bodyguard''s At your side to teleport across the battlefield to
    threaten enemies you didn''t before. Where normally your attacks might be a bit
    weak, because your soulmate is making them it will punish enemies ignoring your
    Challenge that much harder. It also has a low mana and AP cost, so you can use
    it pretty much every fight.

    Finally, Lifesense is a utility tool that can be used to keep track of the status
    of your soulmate should you split up. It has no mana cost, so you can keep it
    up indefinitely if you want to.'
