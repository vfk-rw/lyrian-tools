  description: Mycomancers are powerful mages that harness the power of fungi to heal
    allies and destroy enemies. They try to understand death through mycology.
  guide: 'Mycomancers are a unique healer that relies on dealing damage to heal their
    allies. The only target they can heal is their Spore Symbiote.

    Once it is placed, you can use Saprophytic Bolt to heal your target. Grunts may
    react to it even if its a light attack, so burning their RP first may be advised
    so you don''t waste it.

    Destroying Angel is a bigger heal and also comes with the benefit of instantly
    killing the target when used against grunts. It is not worth using against non-grunts
    however.

    Poison Spore is the last ability that can center around the spore symbiote. It
    can be used as a zoning tool of sorts, but be aware that your allies are not immune
    to the poison. One of the better uses is placing it around yourself or the symbiote
    if they are a more vulnerable target and using the spore as a deterrent to any
    assassin type enemies that might threaten the backline.

    Amoxicillin is a simple disease removal spell. The cast time makes it unusable
    in battle and you are required to identify the disease first, but it''s a free
    removal once you do.

    As a mycomancer, it is recommended you heal early rather than late. Your healing
    can be unreliable and you don''t want your allies to drop low, only for you to
    miss a crucial a heal and watch them go down.'
