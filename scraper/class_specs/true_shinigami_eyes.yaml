      description: Shinigami Eyes mastered.
  description: Wielders of the shinigami eyes, rare as they are, have the ability
    to perceive the death of living things. For most of them, that is where it ends.
    However, there are those who over time grow an even deeper understanding of death.
    They can see the death not just of living things, but also of objects and even
    non-physical things such as magic. This enhanced perception has given those wielders
    the name of the ‘True Shinigami Eyes’.
  guide: 'Wielders of the True Shinigami Eyes bring some personal defense and utility
    to the table. Failing a save can be devastating, but Cut Away gives them an extremely
    high chance to succeed as most of them possess high Focus.

    The high focus also helps them with Cut Magic, allowing them to potentially break
    barriers and other magic effects at little cost. Barriers are the most obvious
    thing, but even things like Glittershards are considered temporary magic effects.

    Point of Death II is an upgrade of the original Point of Death ability. Its primary
    use is to finish off high toughness enemies, but the AP refund makes it a tempting
    choice against any weak foe.

    Their key ability allows them to kill non-living things as well as they do living
    things, and lets them build up marks for their ultimate ability: 7 Points of Death.

    This Climax Art grows in power the more they attack a single target. It takes
    several turns to build up and must be used against a weakened enemy, but it has
    high damage potential. Similar to their previous Secret Art, the damage is static
    so you know what to expect even if there’s a small risk of missing.'
