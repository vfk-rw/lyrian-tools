  guide: 'The battlemaster is an expert in all weapons. If you find a good weapon,
    whether its an artifice, relic or even a divine arms, you will be able to use
    it to its maximum effect.

    You also don''t need to worry about being unable to use certains attack with your
    new weapon due to the Unconventional Weapon ability. It has the potential for
    silly combos, such as using Iai while a greataxe.

    Being a master of battle, they posses ways to punish both Dodge and Guard focused
    characters. Skillful blow has lock-on to make it good against high agility where
    as Mordschlag''s guard crush allows it to punish heavily armored enemies.

    Disarming Attack is their last ability and it can give them the edge in a duel
    against most martial enemies. If they forgot to bring a spare weapon, the disarm
    all but disables them for a turn.'
