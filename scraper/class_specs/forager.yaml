  description: 'From the lively activity of the deep forest to the serene stillness
    of the snowy tundra, a Forager was most at home wandering places no one has traveled
    through in decades (if ever). To take only what was needed, to preserve the beauty
    of what was; that was the motto of many Foragers. An ideal that caused natural
    tension between Foragers and Farmers but even the most steadfast Forager would
    admit that their ways wouldn’t be able to support the growing population of Lyr.

    A true Forager could be recognized by their unique gathering tool: giant scissors.
    Named so due to their general construction of two handles with paired blades connected
    to a pivot point, the giant scissors were reinforced survival multi-tools. Designed
    for the specific needs of each Forager, the scissors often had blades large enough
    to cut a tree in half (or a man) and most came with sharpened tips that could
    be used like a spear when the tool was closed. Serrated or sharpened outer edges
    could allow for sawing and chopping wood, while the handles would sometimes have
    hooks to aid in pulling things down into easy reach. A difficult tool to master
    just for harvesting, those Foragers that trained to fight with them were unpredictable
    dervishes that utilized their unconventional weapon’s quirks to their advantage.

    With a deep connection to the natural world around them and experience born from
    time in the wilderness, Foragers were never truly in danger of running out of
    even the most basic of supplies. Be it food and water or torches, ropes, and even
    shelters, a Forager could often find or fashion some manner of natural replacement.
    With a sharp eye for details honed by spotting tiny gatherable herbs and mushrooms
    (and identifying their properties at a glance), their versatility in supplies,
    and even their strange combat style, any adventure or expedition would do well
    to consider bringing a Forager along.'
  guide: 'The forager is a gatherer and utility class. Their primary use in combat
    is to use Lifebeat Sense to gather information on the HP status of enemies, as
    well as making them easier to be critically hit. This does cost mana, so be careful
    about overusing this.

    Their second combat ability is vivisect, which is an instakill ability with severeal
    requirements to it. While it may look hard to use because of that, in practice
    you can get this off pretty reliably. Simply use Lifebeat Sense on a grunt you
    know is RP exhausted, and you can immediately Vivisect them after. The combo isn''t
    cheap action or mana wise, but it cannot miss which is nice.

    For gathering, you have Verdant Instinct and Divining Petalfall. These are best
    used together. An early Verdant Instinct can give you the information you need,
    then you can replace one with a 5 if needed which allows you to guarantee a Divining
    Petalfall for Lucky Points.'
