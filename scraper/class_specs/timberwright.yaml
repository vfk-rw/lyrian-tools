  description: 'Enid''s Dogfolk ears drooped down as the Timberwright foreman scolded
    her.  So zealous to learn and finish her tasks, she worked with great effort—but
    alone, to put the finishing touches on a wall frame that would be a part of a
    new facility for a famous adventuring guild.  Overwhelmed with work Enid nearly
    fell over from exhaustion before her mentor told her to take a break.

    "A big project like this, you could do it with just one person sure," the Timberwright
    folded his arms across his chest and nodded in thought.  "But you have to learn
    to work with others Eni.  Mothergreen wasn''t built in a day... and it wasn''t
    built with one builder.  We craftsmen have to stick together and help each other
    out... that''s how we create things that are beloved by many.  Things that will
    be remembered long before we pass."

    Enid yawned and then hit herself for the disrespect, "Teacher, I just want to
    make sure that it gets done, so I have to do it myself right?"

    Her mentor smiled, "Perhaps this time you can, but there will be a time when you
    have to learn to work with others.  You''re always off on your own."

    Months passed and the Lumberwright put Enid in charge of a big project—to go along
    with a team to build barracks for the workers of a new magical fuel mine.  The
    Chimera girl, who was comfortable in her solitude was quite happy to keep to herself
    in the middle of the march column—when suddenly a scream rang out.

    "Hobs... out here?!" the fighter shouted.

    A miner clutched his pickaxe as he spun around, swinging his pickaxe at the hobgoblins
    wildly as they ducked and weaved through every strike delivering small cuts and
    blows with every dodge.  The acolyte, in an attempt to assist tripped into the
    miner as they fell into a pile on the ground.

    The Hobgoblin went in for a heavy blow on the two twisted upon the ground as the
    fighter stepped in to guard them.  Enid clutched her axe, swallowed hard and stepped
    forward as her untrained nerves shook her to the core.  The Hob did as Hobs do,
    spinning his blade wildly as he slathered the blade with its own tongue in a taunt.

    Enid nearly lost her grip with her axe, thoughts flashing across her mind—"I don''t
    know how to fight...I can''t do this alone."  She looked up at the Hob and then
    back to the Fighter when her mentors words echoed clearly in her mind, "There
    will be a time where you have to learn to work with others."  She hit herself
    lightly once more, glancing once more at the seasoned fighter beside her.

    The Hobgoblin lunged, blade whistling through the air as iron met iron in rhythmic
    percussion.  The Fighter''s heel dug in, knowing that he couldn''t evade or have
    his comrades injured by the beast.  He leaned back and then delivered a light
    kick to push the Hobgoblin away.  Much to his shock, a force pushed back on his
    foot.

    Standing behind the Hobgloblin, waiting for her chance to strike in unison, she
    pulled the blade of her axe back as it dripped with Hob blood.  The creature whined
    as it fell to the ground, blood pooling underneath it.  It was a perfectly coordinated
    attack.

    Enid smiled in relief as her mentor''s words were realized, "Let''s stick together..."
    she said quietly, more to herself than anyone else as the Fighter nodded in approval.
     The Chimera felt the wisdom of her Timberwright mentor that day, carried on the
    wind.  "That''s how we build something that lasts."'
