  description: 'Archers are the masters of ranged combat, commanding the battlements
    during times of war. Skilled squads of Archers were feared for their ability to
    deliver devastating volleys of missiles at high speed, effectively keeping infantry
    advances at bay. Their keen eyes and sharp intuition allowed them to choose the
    most effective ammunition for maximum impact.

    The title "Archer" originally referred to those who wielded bows, but as technology
    evolved, so did the term. With the invention of crossbows and firearms, those
    who demonstrated exceptional skill with these new weapons still proudly took on
    the title. Today, "Archer" represents anyone with a remarkable talent for ranged
    prowess, regardless of the weapon they use.'
  guide: 'Archers build on the ranger with a heavier focus on ranged attacks. They
    gain Status Assessment II, which in addition to showing HP also informs you of
    damage type strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge on what to use against enemies
    can be very important and this should be used frequently.

    For single target attacks, they gain Snap Shot II. It allows the archer to make
    a light attack at a mana cost. While it competes against the normal snap shot,
    it has no AP cost and is a lot more likely to hit. It is best used when an enemy
    is low on hit points and you lack AP to finish it before it can take a turn.

    The archer is strong against small groups and big groups. Against big groups,
    a volley covers a very large area. Against smaller groups, multishot can target
    multiple enemies with a heavy attack doing serious damage or burning RP. The mana
    cost for overcharging it isn''t too high either, so you could feasibly attack
    several enemies at the same time.

    Finally, for the creative archers out there there is Unerring Aim. While it has
    a less immediately clear combat purpose, targeting things such as a rope holding
    a chandelier or a potion an enemy is holding in their hands can still prove useful.'
