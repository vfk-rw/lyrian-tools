  description: 'In the dust of an artisan''s workshop or in the open clearings of
    a logging company, the hum and chirps of transmutation can be heard.  Transmutation
    is an art, a magic as ancient as Lyr.  Long before the shadows of the great calamity,
    Transmuters were scholars who questioned the very nature of existence.  This pursuit
    led to a mastery over both destruction and creation, spinning the threads of reality
    itself into a tapestry.

    Transmutation is the second branch of alchemy and created a revolution in society.
     It replaced primitive methods such as smelting and manual refinement—which previously
    had artisans sweating over blazing crucibles into the dark hours of the night.
     It isn''t uncommon for master craftsmen to have a Transmuter in their employ
    or as a partner, processing material in the atelier or even helping with the crafting
    itself.  In fact, nowadays there is rarely a town across Lyr without at least
    one person versed in the basics of this ancient art.

    Transmuters manipulate matter at its core, unraveling its threads and rebuilding
    them into entire new forms.  They can shatter stone into dust, or create small
    figurines from blocks of wood.  The control of Transmutation is only limited by
    skill and imagination. Transmutation is the second branch of Alchemy, which itself
    is one of the great pillars of Arcane Magic.

    Yet with great power comes great peril.  Those who understand Transmutation know
    that creation and destruction are two sides of the same coin.  It requires a sound
    mind and body to walk the delicate balance, making Transmuters some of the most
    respected Artisans in any community they are in.'
  guide: 'Transmuter is a class that helps crafting for other classes and provided
    utility in combat.

    Transmute weapon is a simple ability that lets you create a weapon for yourself
    or ally. While you probably don''t want to rely entirely on this for your equipment
    as it costs mana and may not always work, it''s good for providing an emergency
    backup or if there happens to be special material nearby.

    Transmute wall is a reactionary defense against a ranged attack. Because you''ll
    be able to see the damage you''re about to take in most cases, it will be easy
    to judge how much mana you should spend on this. Because it''s a wall and not
    you blocking, this can help you defend against full pierce type of attacks.

    Transmute terrain is a versatile ability that lets you create walls, bridges,
    ledges and other terrain. You can spend a lot of mana on this at once, allowing
    for some creative use such as completely boxing in a character, pushing yourself
    60ft into the air for a sniper position, pushing enemies off a cliff and much
    more.

    Deconstruct is an interlude ability that lets you recycle useless items into usable
    material. Best to use it when you have a large amount of things piled up.

    In crafting, you have a few unique abilities as well as the ability to co-craft.
    This costs you nothing to do by default, so use it whenever you can. Two of your
    co-craft abilities do have a cost and you can also use them in your own crafts.
    Temperature Shock is useful early when you roll poorly to have a guaranteed number
    to your next roll. Once your bonus grows higher or if you need to gamble, Alchemic
    catch will be better as it uses the full bonus you have. If you''re co crafting
    and don''t want to spend money, you can just use bouncing ideas for a free small
    bonus. Finally ragequit is useful if you don''t care about profit by itself and
    only want to make something big. You do lose a lot when using this, so avoid it
    unless you know what you''re doing.'
