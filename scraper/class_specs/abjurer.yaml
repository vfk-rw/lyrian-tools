        damage.
  description: 'Every initiate mage learns early on that the first fundamental of
    magic is defense. But for Abjurers, this lesson became their mantra. These Mages
    took their masters'' teachings to heart and mastered the art of defensive magic.

    Abjurers are incredibly durable, and they don''t just keep that strength to themselvesâ€”they
    can extend it to their allies, making everyone around them tougher in battle.
    Their focus is unmatched, allowing them to control space and protect others, even
    without relying on weapons.

    Despite their power, Abjurers are often underestimated. But when the heat of battle
    comes, they prove their worth, showing remarkable resilience under fire. It''s
    this unshakeable defense that makes them indispensable in the chaos of war.'
  guide: 'Abjurer''s are frontline spellcasters that oftentimes don''t wear armor.
    To help with the durability, you have Mana Shield. Mana Shield gives you a small
    amount of temporary HP every turn. It''s good for reducing a small amount of damage
    every turn, but will not protect from a large burst turn.

    If you expect to take a lot of damage, you can however use Empower Mana Shield.
    This lets you trade mana for temporary HP is an efficient way, however it only
    lasts for a short time so the timing is crucial.

    Mana Shield also lets you cast spells while engaged by enemies if they are challenged
    by you, which can be accomplished by the Spell Challenge key ability. AoE spells
    can be used to inflict Challenge on many enemies, though they won''t apply it
    if they miss or are fully blocked as many of them do not target the enemy, but
    an area. Single target spells will always apply it however.

    To protect your allies and disrupt enemies that go for them, you have Arcane Pull.
    Arcane Pull is effective in keeping your backline safe from melee enemies, but
    it can be useless if there''s not enough distance between you and your allies.

    Finally, Arcane Barrier II is a simple upgrade on the normal arcane barrier, letting
    you add your guard to the guard of the barrier.

    Positioning and choosing how and who to Challenge is key for an Abjurer. Once
    enemies are upon you, you may find it hard to safely apply Spell Challenge if
    not done in advance.'
