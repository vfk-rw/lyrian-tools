  guide: 'The Alchemeister is an alchemist that is more skilled at crafting and using
    the items they craft. Detailed Finish is a good final action when crafting, giving
    you a higher average at no cost.

    With Infuse Potion you are able to heal with potions without requiring your allies
    to drain their own mana, making you a lot more effective as a healer. You don''t
    have to use it every time either, allowing you to make others pay with their mana
    when yours is running low.

    With Counter-Potion you are able to use an alchemy item as a reaction, allowing
    you to do a variety of powerful things. You can toss a flashbang to interrupt
    an action by lowering their AP, toss a slowing flask when an enemy is about to
    approach your ally or toss a molly when they''ve finished moving to make them
    take guaranteed damage. Combine this with Quickdraw Alchemy from alchemist and
    you don''t even need to prepare this action in advance. At any point you can quickdraw
    what you need and toss it.

    Secret Art: All of Creation is a situational ability. Changing the damage type
    will not always be useful, but it can really help amplify damage dealt when against
    an enemy with a vulnerability or weakness. It is also completely free, apart from
    taking up your one secret art per encounter. Special Mention goes to Alchemist
    belonging to a race that can absorb a certain elemental damage, such as Salamander.
    A Salamander alchemist can force any big attack about to hit them to be fire damage,
    which they can easily absorb and turn into healing ofr themselves.'
