  guide: 'Executors are good against mages. Holy Orders gives them sticking power
    to a single target that is almost impossible to escape from. Because they can
    only attack a single target, it does mean they cannot threaten multiple backline
    threats by themselves. Sometimes, it may be worth foregoing the holy orders until
    later.

    Deus Vult can only be used against people who have Holy Orders on them. It allos
    the executor to trade an RP for an offensive boost, making for an attack that
    is hard to dodge. It also gains the shieldbreaker property, which can heavily
    punish mages.

    It is best used in combination with Ave Maria. It has a higher AP cost, so missing
    it is particularly bad which deus vult helps prevent. It can be worth tossing
    out against a target that has no RP left, especially if they have higher guard.
    It also does Holy damage, which may be relevant against some enemies.

    Eagle Hunt is what Executors use to get in range of their targets. They can leap
    over the frontline and land in the back. It may also be used as an escape tool
    or it can be seen as a cheap movement option if you are already planning to use
    Silentium, which gets a 1 AP discount when used during Eagle Hunt. Silentium is
    primarily used against mages, against who disabling their concentration can be
    devastating. It also disables their spells until they remove it, which can be
    seen as effectively lowering their RP or AP for the next turn. Use with Deus Vult
    when you absolutely need to cancel an ongoing spell they are concentrating on.'
