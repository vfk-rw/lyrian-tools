  description: The Aeromaster has taken their abilities to the next level, becoming
    a master of air magic. They are able to wield powerful and destructive spells,
    using their control over the air to unleash devastating storms and gales upon
    their enemies.
  guide: 'The Aeromaster gains increased control over their displacements ability
    through their key ability. This helps them position the enemies they push to set
    them up for their allies.

    Wind Blast II is a more versatile version of Wind Blast, most importantly letting
    you do a precise attack for an almost guaranteed knockback.

    Downburst II allows the aeromaster to punish flying enemies even when its not
    their turn. It has the same properties as the normal downburst otherwise.

    Cyclone is primarily a control tool used for knocking enemies prone that does
    a slight amount of damage. It can also be combo''d into Downburst II, though the
    RP cost may be too high to do it a lot.

    Their Secret Art: Razor Hurricane is another mix of control and damage. The large
    size of it makes it good for locking down areas. It also cannot be destroyed like
    wall type blockades and even if they can take the damage, the knockback is still
    a problem. If you don''t need to seal off an area, you can move it into enemies
    for some extra damage.'
