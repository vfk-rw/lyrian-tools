  guide: 'Saboteurs combine scouting tools with some gadgets and explosives they can
    use in combat.

    Presence Concealment protects you from certain magical tracking tools. Scouting
    Ahead is useful when sneakily trying to move through a dungeon or other dangerous
    place, allowing your group to move stealthily even when not everyone in the group
    has put points into stealth.

    Chemical Explosive is a bomb that can be used to blow up many different things.
    Blowing a hole through a wall, or just blowing up a house straight up are both
    possible. You can only use it once per arc, so you do need to put in a bit of
    thought before committing to it. It can deal a lot of damage if it hits a person,
    but the detonation time is too long for it to see use in combat.

    Flash Bomb is effectively a free flashbang flask that allows a save. Daze is pretty
    powerful when you can inflict it on multiple people, tossing a flash bomb every
    turn can be worth it, even against just a single enemy.

    Wire Sweep is another potentially powerful CC tool. Because it is a save instead
    of an attack, enemies with low toughness may find it hard to defend against.'
