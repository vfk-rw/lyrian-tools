  guide: 'The windbringer is a wind based support that focuses on movement.

    They start the battle by giving their allies Tailwind, which increases their initiative
    and boosts their movement speed. This is especially useful when you start far
    away from the enemy and have many melee focused fighters in the party.

    If you need even more movement speed, you can activate Gale-Wind Aura. 20ft movement
    speed increase is a big boost and since your allies keep it after leaving the
    aura, they can cross great distances in a single turn.

    Headwind instead hampers enemy. You need to be somewhat close to an enemy for
    it to take effect, but it''s an otherwise unavoidable slow. Once you and your
    allies have engaged the front most enemy, Headwind can be used to deny their allies
    a chance to help.

    Fly gives flying to yourself or an ally. The mana cost and upkeep makes this not
    something you can use continuously in a fight. Instead, grant allies small bursts
    of Fly to increase their movement and allow them to go up to hard to reach places.'
