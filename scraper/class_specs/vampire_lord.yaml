  description: 'Vampire Lords drift through the pages of history like living shadows—accursed
    souls chained to undeath by the very forces that empower them. In dimly lit taverns,
    alongside whispered tales of Dragons and other legendary horrors, travelers speak
    of eerie encounters and boast of glimpses caught at the corner of a moonlit eye.
    Whether these sightings are truth or fancy, one thing is certain: the name Vampire
    Lord stirs fear and fascination in equal measure.

    Unlike lesser Vampires who lose themselves to bloodlust or despair, Vampire Lords
    have embraced their curse, searching its depths to forge a power all their own.
    They understand their twisted existence at a level few can rival, developing uncanny
    resistances to the sun’s harsh sting and other infamous banes of their kind. Yet
    what truly sets them apart is their mastery over the delicate threads connecting
    the Arcane, Faith, and Astra—allowing them to skirt the borders of Higher Order
    Magic. Their Vampiric Domination arises from this warped interplay of energies,
    a distant, corrupted echo of the Mystic Eye once claimed by the fabled Aseria
    clan of Sorthen.

    That unholy gift grants them the power to ensnare weaker minds, exerting a terrible
    control that echoes across dark corridors and silent chambers. Even so, few mortals
    have battled a Vampire Lord and returned with their lives, for these lords of
    night prefer to move in secrecy. Outwardly, they can seem disarmingly regal—yet
    beneath that lies a being forever dancing on the razor’s edge between life and
    the endless darkness. Should you cross paths with a Vampire Lord, know this—their
    secrets run deeper than any mortal can fathom, and their hunger, while tempered,
    still seeks knowledge and power in their cursed existence.'
  guide: 'A lot of the vampire lord builds on what the vampire does.

    Feeding Frenzy gives you a free bite whenever you down someone while in Blood
    Frenzy, allowing you to regain 1 mana. If fighting a lot of grunts you can reliably
    kill, this can effectively half the upkeep cost of Blood Frenzy.

    Vampiric Domination is a stronger version of the fascination. You can choose to
    have a permanent servant, or you can use it more situationally such as to dominate
    enemies to extract information from them, dominate people of import to have them
    aid you. They will know what you did afterwards, so it''s recommended not to stay
    around when you''re done with them.

    Bloodbolt is a simple ranged option that can be lacking as a normal vampire. You
    can invest HP into it for extra damage, but this might not be worth doing in most
    cases unless you plan to Blood Frenzy shortly after.

    Your Secret Art: Bloody Ritual is a powerful AoE ability. The damage is guaranteed
    unless the tether is broken and if you can hit enough enemies with the ability,
    you can even refund the mana you spent on it. Due to the range on the ability
    and the slowing effect, it can be a powerful zoning tool even if enemies do manage
    to break it.'
