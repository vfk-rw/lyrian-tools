  description: Marksman is a single-target ranged powerhouse.  They rain heavy damage
    onto the enemy from afar and can be devastating if not stopped.
  guide: 'Marksman gain Status Assessment II, which in addition to showing HP also
    informs you of damage type strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge on what to use
    against enemies can be very important and this should be used frequently.

    Blast Away is a self peeling tool that knocks the enemy back on a failed save,
    letting you safely move away from the target afterwards.

    Prone Cover is another form of defense that lets you drop prone as a reaction.
    It gives the prone keyword to your ranged attacks and basic reactions, so you
    aren''t left completely vulnerable while on the floor. You will have to spend
    AP to stand up again if you need to move, so it''s not something you want to always
    immediately use.

    Consistent Shot combined the accuracy of a precise attack with the damage of a
    heavy attack. Primarily used when you want a high chance of dealing good damage
    against a target that still has RP remaining.

    Perfect Shot can do a lot of damage, but is reliant on your teammates to keep
    enemies within your line of sight for long enough. If your target breaks line
    of sight, the ability is wasted. To keep your options the most open, it is best
    to start your perfect shot by spending 2 AP as the last action on your turn. Now
    if you can''t finish it, you will have only wasted 2 AP instead of 4.'
