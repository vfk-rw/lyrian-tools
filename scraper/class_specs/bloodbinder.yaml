  guide: 'As a Bloodbinder, you’ll want to hover around 50% HP to get the most out
    of Crimson Enmity. It’s a bit of a balancing act, but the extra healing boost
    is worth it.

    Your bread-and-butter combo is Transfusion followed by Blood Drain. Start by healing
    your allies with Transfusion, then use Blood Drain to top up your own HP. It’s
    a great way to keep both you and your team in the fight without leaving yourself
    too vulnerable.

    Blood Shield is super effective when you cast it on someone with high guard. It’s
    a two for one—blocking damage while also healing them up, so it’s a great move
    when you need to protect and patch up a teammate at the same time.

    Life Sacrifice takes you down to just 1 HP, but all that lost health goes directly
    into healing an ally, which can be a real game-changer when things get rough.
    If you pair it with Crimson Enmity, you can really boost its impact and turn the
    tide when your team needs it most.'
