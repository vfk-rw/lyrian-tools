      description: Mage mastered.
  description: 'While many Mages focus on transforming mana into different elements,
    Arcanists take a different path. They dedicate themselves to mastering its purest
    form—the raw, unaltered magic known as Arcane. It might not be as flashy as other
    types of magic, but when it comes to sheer power, nothing else comes close.

    Arcane magic is notoriously difficult to defend against. However, it demands a
    lot from the caster, drawing heavily on their personal mana reserves. That''s
    why Arcanists spend so much time meditating and training—to build up their mana
    and ensure they can wield this potent force.

    These Mages are the masters of fundamental attack magic, capable of delivering
    devastating blows of pure magical energy. When it''s raw power you need, an Arcanist
    is the one you want on your side.'
  guide: 'Arcanists have relatively high mana costs, but their expanded circuits key
    ability gives them a bit extra to work with. Arcane Buster is a tool for dealing
    with opposing spellcasters due to its shieldbreaker property.

    Arcane Explosion is a simple AoE spell that forces you to get close to the action.
    In exchange, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity and has the rapid keyword.
    If you''re swarmed by grunts, two arcane explosions can go a long way to clearing
    them out.

    To help with this, Arcane Power exists. It has a steep mana cost, but costs no
    action and all spells in this class do arcane damage.

    Finally, they have Magic Missile II which is a spammable version of Magic Missile.
    This is also powerful when used in conjunction with Arcane Power, especially against
    enemies that rely on dodge. 4 Arcane Power''d Magic Missiles are a serious threat
    against them.'
