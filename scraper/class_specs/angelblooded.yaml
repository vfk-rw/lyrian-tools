  description: Angelblooded are humans with angelic heritage that can transform into
    semi-divine beings.
  guide: 'The main appeal of the angelblooded is the True Divine Release. Not only
    does it give flight and extra movement speed, it is also a requirement to use
    the other two abilities of the class. Unfortunately, the upkeep and cost make
    it hard to use until you obtain God''s Blessing, which reduces both to 0.

    Once this class is mastered, it becomes very powerful. On top of the benefits
    mentioned above, you get to make a free light attack every round. You also get
    to do a stronger block every round, making blocking an option even if your toughness
    is low and you''re not wearing armor.

    Even after mastering it, it is still a once per arc ability. Make sure you don''t
    use it too early.'
