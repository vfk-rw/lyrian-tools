  description: Berserkers are aggressive fighters that almost completely ignore defense
    in exchange for more offense.
  guide: 'Berserkers are highly aggresive fighters that rely on allies to keep them
    alive. They are centered around their rage stance, which gives them 2 bonus AP
    in exchange for disabling RP abilities. A person without RP is extremely vulnerable,
    so you will need allies to cast thing like the acolyte''s Angel''s Embrace on
    you for protection. Alternatively, you can wait with using it until you are have
    burned through some RP already. You will lose out on some power, but it may be
    better than going down.

    Both Break Free and Fallen Friend fit the playstyle of waiting with Rage Stance
    instead of using it immediately. Break Free especially is powerful against enemies
    with heavy CC effects.

    Into the fray is a gap closer that lets you approach an enemy without spending
    AP, allowing for a maximum amount of attacks after. The RP cost makes it so its
    best used when already in rage stance where your RP is less useful.

    The same applies to Reckless Strike. Normally trading 1 RP for 1 AP is not worth
    it, but when you can''t use your RP anyway, it is a good way to get some extra
    damage in.'
