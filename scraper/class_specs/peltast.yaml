      description: Any class mastered. Proficiency in throwing weapons.
  description: A specialist in using throwing weapons.
  guide: 'The peltast makes throwing weapons a valid choice for a main weapon. The
    boomerang key ability makes it so you no longer have to keep paying AP to draw
    more weapons. The peltast ideally wants to play close to the enemy and isn''t
    afraid of melee combat.

    Long Toss gives you a long range option. The range of throwing weapons is normally
    a bit low, so this can be used when you would be out of range to attack normally.

    Rappelling Dagger is a movement option that can also deal damage. Useful when
    you have to engage an enemy that''s not too far away and it can be used to obtain
    high ground by rappelling into a tree or on top of a building.

    Fan of Knives is a point blank AoE that can be used even when engaged in melee.
    It will require you to get close to the enemy before you can use it.

    Stab & Throw is an AP efficient attack that requires you to be in melee, plus
    to have another enemy nearby.'
