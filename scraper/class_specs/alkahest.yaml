      description: Transmuter mastered
  description: 'While Transmuters provide foundations for everyday life and artisan
    work, Alkahests are those who are obsessed with the subtleties of matter and creation.
     Alkahests are the experts in the fields of Transmutational Alchemy, quickly altering
    reality with precision and artistic flair.  They''re able to immediately concept
    and transmute just the right tool for any situation.

    Historically, one Alkahest above all others was a pioneer in her field.  She remains
    celebrated across Lyr to this day—Etoile Dacquoise.  While her best friend and
    rival, Riannon Aquanas, focused on the art of core Alchemy, Etoile dedicated her
    life to mastering the complexities of Transmutation.  In the atelier together,
    these pioneers had opened an often historically referenced shop in the Kingdom
    of Mothergreen—and became the foundation of innovation during Lyr''s darkest hours.

    Historical word of mouth speaks of Etoile''s contributions from behind the scenes
    in the battle against Heira, the Goddess of Evil.  Although she never wielded
    a sword on the front lines, her mastery of transmutation alongside Riannon''s
    expertise in alchemical creations created the tools and solutions needed by their
    friends that did.  The members of those legendary heroes helped create that shop
    themselves, as the procurement arm of the business.  Etoile''s legacy is still
    immortalized to this day behind the statues of Riannon and the other heroes:

    Elly, The Hero

    Uruka, The Sylph

    Signum, The Heretic

    Leaflit, The Pixie

    Brynhildr, The Dragon

    Basalt, The Dwarf

    Today''s Alkahests follow in Etoile''s footsteps and in her teachings, fulfilling
    their roles as vital supporters and adventurers, heroes and innovators alike.
     They sometimes provide assistance from the sidelines, demonstrating that heroism
    is not only about direct confrontation but also wits, innovation and dedication
    to a future victory.'
  guide: 'The Alkahest is a crafter and utility class with very limited combat potential.

    Your best combat ability is your Secret Art: Transmute Proto Armatae. While it
    costs a fair bit of mana, you can view the armatae''s HP as getting a ton of bonus
    HP that stacks with temporary HP. In addition, you get to make a free attack each
    turn. It doesn''t increase your damage output much (or at all), but it''s good
    defensively. You can use it defensively by spending RP and absorb a hit with the
    free 20 HP shield it comes with.

    Alchemical Detonation is your other ability that can be used in combat, although
    it is situational. Strong when you''re against enemies that use wall creation.
    It also has strong out of combat benefits, allowing you enter virtually any building
    at little cost.

    Transmute Effective Implement is another out of combat tool that can grant you
    a massive bonus to a skill check. If you''re willing to spend enough mana, you
    can succeed at almost any check if you want to.

    Siphon Materials costs an interlude point, but it lets you extract valuable materials
    that might otherwise be wasted in an item you can''t use. You could extract the
    silver from a katana to have a blacksmith make it into a dagger for example.

    Finally, stabilize matter is another co crafting ability. It statistically beats
    out the other options, though you do have to precast it instead of using it after
    you see the roll. A small bit of creation lets you convert a herb to one of a
    different element at the cost of reducing the rarity. Using this reduces the value
    of herb, so it should only be done if you desperately need the herb.'
