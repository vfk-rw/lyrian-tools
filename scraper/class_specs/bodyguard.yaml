  description: Bodyguards specialize in protecting a single person.
  guide: 'The bodyguard is focused around protecting a single target. You can choose
    who this target is with VIP Protection. They are well-suited to escort and protection
    missions, but even in normal ones they synergize well with squishy melee allies.
    Since they automatically get hit and can''t react when using the redirect part
    of VIP Protection, having high Toughness and wearing armor is recommended.

    With Temporary Protection, the bodyguard can pay a heavy mana cost to protect
    another ally. It should only be used in emergencies, but using it on a low health
    ally can keep them in the fight without them having to play super defensive.

    Shelter is a more limited, but powerful version of the re-direct of the key ability.
    Heavy Attacks will do a lot of damage if you take them without reacting, so Shelter
    is best saved for those attacks.

    At your side helps you with positioning. It can save your VIP target when they
    do something stupid or if they get forcefully moved, but it can also be used offensively
    to teleport next to them when they charge ahead.

    Vengeance is a cheaper heavy attack that can be used if your VIP target was attacked.
    If the condition is met, there''s rarely a reason not to use it. It becomes even
    more powerful if your VIP target is below 0 HP, though you obviously do not want
    that situation to happen to begin with.'
