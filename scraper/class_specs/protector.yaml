  guide: 'The protector gains access to greatshield to help in their tanking. Like
    heavy armor, equipping a greatshield may be overkill on the defensive front. However,
    it comes with the benefit of letting your allies use you as cover, so greatshield
    + medium armor is better than normal shield + heavy armor if you have to choose
    between them.

    With no getting past!, ignoring the protector''s attacks of opportunities is basically
    impossible. It has sure hit and applies a slow at the minimum, so unless the target
    has high block there''s little chance they can move at full speed away from a
    protector. The option to use a heavy attack exists as well. While a sure hit heavy
    attack is normally really strong, due to your heavy armor you probably do not
    have the RP to spare on it.

    Provoke II is a fire and forget challenge ability that keeps an enemy taunted
    for the entire fight. You don''t want to keep switching this around since the
    AP cost is too high for it, so just put it on the most dangerous enemy and leave
    it there.

    Bullet Magnet is a tool for protecting your allies from ranged attacks. You have
    to use it on your turn, so you have to be aware of when enemy archers are in position
    to shoot your allies. It is a great ability to help win ranged battles, especially
    if you can find low or even high cover to hide behind.

    The Secret Art: Shield Wall is effectively a party wide invulnerability against
    a single ability. The mana cost is very high, but this can save everyone''s life
    when used against a powerful AoE attack.'
