  description: 'The first Aeromancer corps were born in Northi, created as a direct
    response to Sorthen''s formidable Ace Aerial Mage squads. While the Catfolk had
    a stronghold on the ground with their incredible speed, the Fae and Sorthen flyers
    posed a constant threat from above. That is, until a cunning Catfolk mage named
    Nicole Mimi changed the game.

    Mimi took a magical art that was once considered weak, Aeromancy, and turned it
    into a force to be reckoned with. By destabilizing the air itself, she crafted
    powerful gales and sudden downbursts, effectively disrupting air superiority.
    What was once seen as a lesser magic became a devastating weapon under her mastery.

    To this day, Aeromancers from all corners of the world study Mimi''s tomes, learning
    to command the sky just as she did. They''ve turned Aeromancy into an art of its
    own, capable of twisting the winds and reshaping the battlefield.'
  guide: 'Aeromancers take on a more controllery striker role, displacing enemies
    while attacking them. They are very dangerous when near cliffs or other hazards.
    Their difficulty lies in the importance of their positioning. Knockbacks do damage
    if the target can not be moved the full distance, so knocking enemies into walls
    can add a decent amount of damage.

    Wind Blast is a low investment ability that provides significant displacement.
    While using it near hazards is the obvious choice, it can also be used to free
    up space for allies or to push the enemy closer to your allies so they can spend
    more AP on attacking instead of moving.

    Wind Scatter is an almost pure disruption tool. It makes further AoE''s impossible,
    so careful use is required to not disrupt your allies. A good Wind Scatter however,
    can put significant distance between the front most and backmost enemy of a formation,
    which allows for targets to be isolated and picked off.

    Wind Buffet is a more defensive knockback, forcing enemies away from you. Be careful,
    as it provokes attacks of opportunities and can hit allies.

    Downburst is a simple, but extremely powerful anti-air tool. With high range and
    lock-on, an aeromancer is a aerial mage or flying monster''s worst nightmare.'
