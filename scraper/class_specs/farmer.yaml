  description: '“Bennachd na Yggdrasil ar talah se.”

    The Blessing of Yggdrasil upon this land. The traditional words spoken over a
    Farmer’s field before any work is done for the season. Passed down through the
    generations, most modern Farmers have no knowledge of its origin or the significance
    it holds in prayer to an old god. Attempts by the Church of Light to coin their
    own blessing by Kari has had mixed results throughout history, with the traditional
    appeal seeming to always be measurably more effective. The prayer was ultimately,
    and grudgingly, accepted by the Church but there were still occasional movements
    and studies made to replace it with something “more holy”.

    From the expansive wheat fields of Dacquoise to the carefully tended orchards
    of Sylvan, the ancient words of blessing were spoken and passed down from father
    to son, mother to daughter, master to apprentice. While every farmer may know
    the words, may know the varying rituals, it was the head Farmer of the village
    that would lead each blessing. Often thought of as the wizened elder (to the annoyance
    of those much younger that have learned the ways of the blessing), it was common
    for the head Farmer to bless a towns’ fields in a rotation. While it wasn’t as
    glamorous as becoming a mage or a knight or an adventurer, there was always a
    steady apprenticeship across Lyr, of families and communities teaching and training
    the next generation.

    To the Farmer, the connection to the land was a palpable thing, the energy flowing
    from them and into them in equal measure. While this gave Farmers a tendency to
    plant roots of their own and remain in one place, some took their brief connection
    to the natural world as a call. To discover and see as much of the world they
    could connect to as possible. But most importantly of all, no farmer or Farmer
    would ever forget the benediction of the harvest:

    “Gabthasinn a toirt Yggdrasil don tiodlac seo.”

    We thank Yggdrasil for this gift.'
  guide: 'The farmer is a crafting class that functions as a controller when in combat.

    Scarecrow''s Gaze is your most important tool in fights against groups of enemies.
    The most common use for this will be to stand together with your backline, then
    use it to prevent enemies from easily targeting your vulnerable targets in the
    back. You could also go on the offensive yourself and use it to ensure that you
    or an ally can''t be threatened while going for an enemy spellcaster. The core
    of this ability is to ensure the enemies have little choice but to attack your
    tank.

    Plow the fields is a cheap AoE attack that also creates difficult terrain for
    1 turn. Can be used pre-emptively to make an enemies advance more difficult.

    Wither the stalk is a strong debuff against a single enemy. Denying the use of
    Power will remove a lot of damage from an attack and this is especially powerful
    against less intelligent enemies with set patterns that use their strong attacks
    at the start of their turn.

    On the crafting side, farmers are IP intensive compared to other crafters. While
    they can make a lot of goods (and profit), you are forcing yourself to commit
    to 2 IP to get any benefit out of it. Pull the weeds should be seen as an emergency
    tool to get a sudden 5 crafting points at the cost of losing some profit. If you''re
    only a few points off a big upgrade such as infuse Qi, then it''s probably worth
    using.'
