  guide: 'The trickster is a support class that provides weird and unique benefits
    to the team.

    Assign Decoy gives the unique ability to taunt an enemy by an ally that would
    normally have no access to it. It can be used to temporarily make an enemy switch
    targets or if in a party without a tank, can be used to set up a sort of tank
    rotation.

    Swap gives the Trickster high control over the battlefield. They can walk near
    the edge of a clif, then swap an enemy next to it. Forcefully group enemies to
    setup for a teammates AoE attack. Swap an ally out of danger and much more. Extremely
    versatile and due to its Rapid nature and low cost can easily be spammed.

    Misdirected Blow has some conditions for it to be good, but it can turn enemies
    against each other. Most effective on tricksters with high agility, as it can
    let you evade blows that will hit most other targets.

    The Secret Art Grand Theater allows the trickster to set up a magnificent performance.
    They can force enemies to hit each other and give allies free actions. They just
    need to be careful, because even their allies are forced to attack and careless
    use may force them to attack an ally.

    Their perfect mimicry has little combat potential, but it allows a trickster to
    truly infiltrate a place and sow chaos.'
