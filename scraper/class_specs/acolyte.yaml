  description: 'Acolytes are practitioners of the mysterious power known as Faith,
    which is believed to be the oldest form of magic. In a world where The Church
    of Kari reigns as the most dominant religion, most Acolytes, about 95%, are Human,
    and nearly all of them, around 99%, belong to the Church.

    Acolytes are people with a special calling, blessed with the power to perform
    miracles thanks to their deep faith. They''re part of a bigger community that
    includes other Acolytes, priests, and sometimes even Paladins. Because of this,
    they can usually find a safe place to rest and get help in churches and temples
    wherever they go.

    With their healing and protective abilities, Acolytes are essential members of
    any party, making sure their friends stay safe and well during tough battles.'
  guide: 'Acolytes are the main healers of groups of new adventurers, being the only
    tier 1 class with the capability to heal others.

    Their primary tool for this is Cure Touch. The mana cost is high, but it is still
    more efficient (and cheaper) than drinking a potion. Keep in mind that it does
    provoke attacks of opportunity, so position yourself behind the ally you''re healing
    if they are in melee combat.

    Light''s Care is Â some efficient after combat healing. It heals for the same amount
    as Cure Touch for a fraction of the mana cost. It also has the benefit of allowing
    the target to prevent an injury to themselves if they went down in combat.

    What makes an acolyte truly valuable for a newbie group is Angel''s Embrace. It
    has no mana cost and reduces the damage an ally takes by a large amount. The range
    is short, so most acolyte''s prefer a melee weapon. Since you are using your RP
    to help others, be wary that you don''t put yourself in a position where the enemy
    can focus you as your RP dwindles.

    Miracle: Sanctuary creates a small but durable barrier that can be used both offensively
    and defensively. When used defensively, it can give your allies a moment of reprieve,
    letting them drink a potion before going for a round two. It can also be used
    to trap an enemy inside the barrier, isolating it from its allies while your own
    allies wail on it.'
