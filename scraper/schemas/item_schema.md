  lore_text: string          # Extended lore description
```

## ID Generation Rules

```python
def generate_item_id(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Convert item name to ID following these rules:
    - Lowercase all characters
    - Replace spaces with underscores
    - Replace parentheses with double dashes
    - Remove other special characters
    
    Examples:
    - "Katana (Heavy)" -> "katana--heavy-"
    - "Greater Healing Potion" -> "greater_healing_potion"
    - "Blacksmith's Hammer" -> "blacksmiths_hammer"
    """
    id = name.lower()
    # Handle parentheses specially
    id = id.replace('(', '--').replace(')', '-')
    # Replace spaces
    id = id.replace(' ', '_')
    # Remove apostrophes and other special chars
    id = id.replace("'", "")
    # Clean up any remaining special characters
    id = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9_\-]', '', id)
    return id
```

## Cost Parsing Patterns

```yaml
# Different cost formats found
cost_patterns:
  - "1000 Clim"              # Standard currency
  - "Varies"                 # Variable cost (materials)
  - ""                       # Empty string for some special items
  - "500-2000 Clim"          # Range of costs
  - "Original Weapon + 3000" # Formula-based costs
  
activation_cost_patterns:
  - "2 AP"                   # Action points
  - "0 AP, 4 Mana"           # Multiple costs
  - "1 RP"                   # Reaction points
  - null                     # No activation cost (was "-")
  - "X Mana"                 # Variable cost
```

## HTML Structure Patterns

### List Page Structure
```
app-items > div > div > app-item-card
  mat-card
    img.item-image
    mat-card-content
      h3.item-name
      mat-chip-list (type badges)
      div.cost-info
    mat-card-actions
      a[routerLink] (to detail page)
```

### Detail Page Structure
```
app-item-detail
  div.item-container
    div.item-image > img
    div.item-content
      h2 (name with âˆ™ prefix)
      div.properties-panel
        div.property-row (multiple)
          span.property-label
          span.property-value
      div.description-section
        h3 "Description:"
        div.description-content
          (nested content varies by type)
```

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields
- `name` - Cannot be empty
- `id` - Must be valid (lowercase, underscores, dashes only)
- `type` - Must be one of the defined main types
- `sub_type` - Must be valid for the parent type
- `cost` - Must be present (can be "-" or "Varies")

### Type Validation
```python
VALID_TYPES = {
    "Equipment": ["Weapon", "Armor", "Accessory"],
    "Artifice": ["Airship", "Device", "Construct"],
    "Alchemy": ["Potion", "Poison", "Bomb", "Oil"],
    "Crafting": ["Materials", "Component", "Tool"],
    "Consumable": ["Food", "Scroll", "Ammunition"],
    "Quest": ["Key Item", "Trophy", "Document"]
}
```

### Numeric Validation
- `burden` >= 0 (can be 0 for weightless items)
- `crafting_points` > 0 (if present)
- `armor_value` >= 0 (for armor)
- All costs should parse to valid numbers or special values

## Special Parsing Considerations

### Complex Material Descriptions
Blacksmithing Materials have nested structures that need careful parsing:
- Base materials section with table of materials
- Special materials section with different structure
- Each material has multiple properties to extract

### Artifice Modifications
- Modifications are tiered (A/B)
- Some have prerequisites
- Parse both name and full description
- Track dependency chains

### Alchemy Recipes
- Herb requirements specify quantity + rarity + element
- Some recipes have alternative ingredients
- Material costs separate from herb costs
- Parse specific herb names when mentioned

### Variable Fields
Some fields only appear for certain item types:
- `damage_dice` - Only for weapons
- `armor_value` - Only for armor
- `modifications` - Only for artifice
- `crafting_recipe` - Only for alchemy
