# Class Specification Analysis - Complete Summary

## Overview

Systematic analysis of all 116 classes from the Angel's Sword TTRPG website has been completed. This document summarizes the findings and updates made to accommodate the actual data patterns found.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Scraped all 116 classes** using the modular scraper architecture
2. **Parsed HTML to YAML** using the current ClassParser
3. **Analyzed patterns systematically** using automated analysis tools
4. **Updated class specification** to handle discovered patterns
5. **Created improvement plan** for parser enhancements

## Key Findings

### Data Consistency
The analysis revealed remarkably consistent patterns across all 116 classes, indicating systematic parsing behavior rather than data variability.

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. "Heart" Attribute Issue (100% of classes)
- **Problem**: All classes show `attribute: "heart"` instead of actual attribute names
- **Impact**: Makes attribute progression data unusable
- **Root Cause**: Parser extracting generic value instead of parsing description text

#### 2. Simple String Requirements (93% of classes)
- **Problem**: Requirements use simple string arrays instead of structured format
- **Impact**: Limits ability to parse and validate complex requirements
- **Pattern**: Most common patterns include "Any class mastered", "Specific class mastered", and complex multi-condition requirements

#### 3. Skills Structure Missing (100% of classes)
- **Problem**: Skills benefits only contain description text, no structured data
- **Impact**: Cannot programmatically access skill lists, conversion rules, etc.
- **Missing Data**: eligible_skills, can_convert_to_expertise, conversion_ratio

#### 4. Attribute Choice Simplification (100% of classes)
- **Problem**: Using simple string arrays instead of {attribute, value} objects
- **Impact**: Assumes all choices are +1 bonuses, loses flexibility
- **Pattern**: All follow format like ["Power", "Focus", "Agility"]

#### 5. Secret Art ID Inconsistencies (42% of classes)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent underscore patterns in Secret Art ability IDs
- **Impact**: Makes programmatic ability lookup unreliable
- **Examples**: 
  - ❌ `secret_art_efficient_spirit_control`
  - ✅ `secret_art__efficient_spirit_control`

## Specification Updates Made

### 1. Requirements Format Flexibility
Updated spec to support both simple string lists (current data) and structured requirements (future enhancement):

```yaml
# Format 1: Simple string list (current data)
requirements: 
  - "Any class mastered."
  - "Have at least 1 spell"

# Format 2: Structured (future)
requirements:
  type: "and"
  conditions:
    - type: "class_mastery"
      value: "any"
    - type: "spell"
      minimum: 1
```

### 2. Attribute Handling
Documented both current format issues and proper structure:

```yaml
# Current (WRONG):
- type: "attribute"
  attribute: "heart"  # Invalid
  description: "You gain +1 Reason."

# Correct format:
- type: "attribute"
  attribute: "Reason"
  description: "You gain +1 Reason."
```

### 3. Progression Benefit Types
Added support for multiple attribute choice formats and documented the "heart" issue:

```yaml
# Current data format
options: ["Power", "Focus", "Agility"]

# Structured format (preferred)
options:
  - attribute: "Power"
    value: 1
  - attribute: "Focus"
    value: 1
```

### 4. Skills Structure
Documented both current description-only format and structured format with examples for parser improvement.

## Classes Requiring Special Attention

Based on complex requirements patterns:

### Breakthrough Requirements
- **Angelblooded**: "Must have the Angelblooded breakthrough"
- **Vampire**: "Must have the Curse of Vampirism breakthrough"  
- **Shinigami Eyes**: "must have the Touched by Death breakthrough"

### Multi-Class Requirements
- **Assassin**: "Rogue mastered", "any tier 2 class mastered"
- **Colossus**: "Any tier 2 class mastered. Fighter mastered"
- **Trickster**: "Two classes mastered", "of which 1 must be a tier 2 class"

### Complex Skill/Expertise Requirements
- **Bard**: "Have at least 5 skill points in the Art (Singing) expertise or at least 5 points in an Art expertise of an instrument"
- **Dragoon**: "10 Points in the Athletics (Jumping) expertise skill"
- **Tactician**: "5 skill points in the history skill"

### Spell/Ability Requirements
- **Abjurer**: "Arcane Barrier learned", "must possess at least 1 spell that deals damage"
- **Thief**: "must possess Decipher Magic ability"
- **Battle Mage**: "Have at least 1 spell", "Be proficient in at least 1 melee weapon"

### Race Requirements
- **Shield Paladin**: "Human, proficient with shields", "medium armor"
- **Sword Paladin**: "Human."

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Critical)
1. **Fix "heart" attribute parsing** - affects all 116 classes
2. **Normalize Secret Art IDs** - affects 49 classes
3. **Create structured attribute choices** - improves data consistency

### Priority 2 (Important)  
1. **Extract structured skills data** from descriptions
2. **Implement structured requirements parsing** for complex cases
3. **Add validation against updated specification**

### Priority 3 (Enhancement)
1. **Create automated tests** for parser improvements
2. **Add edge case handling** for unique class patterns
3. **Implement incremental updates** for future data changes

## Files Created/Updated

1. **`class_spec.md`** - Updated with comprehensive format documentation
2. **`PARSER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`** - Detailed technical implementation plan
3. **`analyze_spec_gaps.py`** - Analysis tool for systematic pattern detection
4. **`CLASS_SPEC_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. **Implement parser improvements** following the improvement plan
2. **Test improvements** on all 116 classes
3. **Validate output** against updated specification
4. **Create integration tests** for future maintenance
5. **Document edge cases** as they are discovered

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified systematic parsing issues affecting all classes and created a comprehensive specification that accommodates both current data limitations and future improvements. The updated specification provides clear guidance for both current data consumers and future parser enhancements.

The high consistency of patterns (93-100% affected rates) confirms these are implementation issues rather than data variability, making them suitable targets for systematic fixes that will improve data quality across the entire dataset.
