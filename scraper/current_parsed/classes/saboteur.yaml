  guide: Saboteurs combine scouting tools with some gadgets and explosives they can
    use in combat. Presence Concealment protects you from certain magical tracking
    tools. Scouting Ahead is useful when sneakily trying to move through a dungeon
    or other dangerous place, allowing your group to move stealthily even when not
    everyone in the group has put points into stealth. Chemical Explosive is a bomb
    that can be used to blow up many different things. Blowing a hole through a wall,
    or just blowing up a house straight up are both possible. You can only use it
    once per arc, so you do need to put in a bit of thought before committing to it.
    It can deal a lot of damage if it hits a person, but the detonation time is too
    long for it to see use in combat. Flash Bomb is effectively a free flashbang flask
    that allows a save. Daze is pretty powerful when you can inflict it on multiple
    people, tossing a flash bomb every turn can be worth it, even against just a single
    enemy. Wire Sweep is another potentially powerful CC tool. Because it is a save
    instead of an attack, enemies with low toughness may find it hard to defend against.
