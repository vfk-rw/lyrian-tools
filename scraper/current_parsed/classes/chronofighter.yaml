  description: Chronofighter is a melee-focused class that uses time power to enhance
    their attacks.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered
  - proficient in any melee weapon.
  guide: Chronofighter is a complex class that relies in setting up future turns to
    take advantage of attacks from the past. Attacks from the past is a difficult
    ability to use. Because everything is exactly mirrored based of the position of
    your previous turn and you cannot move before using it, it comes down to planning
    and a bit of luck to make good use of. However, when it does, the result is amazing.
    Being able to double your attacks are almost no cost is incredibly powerful. Accelerating
    Strike is a tool that should be combined with the Delay encounter start action,
    which is free for a Chronofighter. This lets you loop enemies at a crucial point,
    letting you take two turns in a row before they can respond. Delayed Hit is a
    good tool getting around temporary guard buffs. The target can still Block the
    damage when it hits the turn later, but less intelligent creatures may get faked
    out by the weird nature of the attack and try to react to it from the start. Butterfly
    Effect is a ramping ability. The initial mana cost is extremely high and it is
    not until the third use that it becomes a good use. The total mana cost before
    it becomes free is 9 mana and it takes at least 3 turns of stacking. Keep this
    in mind before using it, as it is a heavy commitment and a big waste of mana if
    you can't get max value out of it. When a fight does last long though and you
    get to keep stacking it, it is one of the most powerful abilities that exists.
