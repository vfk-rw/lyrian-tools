  description: On Sorthen's Marlone coast, where Lizardfolk pilehouses rise above
    the crashing waves, to the spires of Merlin's Academy of magic in Northi—wherever
    Carpenters go, civilization follows. Since the first dawn of Lyr, these artisans
    were the backbone of civilization. Between their awl, saw and hammer they built
    up military camps into fortresses and small villages into thriving metropolises.
    Carpenters are far from just competent in their art and tools, they also understand
    that cooperation is necessary for great works. It doesn't matter if its to erect
    a guildhall estate or to confront the threat of a siege of hobgoblin raiders—Carpenters
    always work together with their allies like hammer and nail. Crafting far more
    than just still buildings, their carvings can be seen in hand and belt for many
    denizens of the realm. From the first wooden tools, to finely tuned bows from
    the finest Yew—their equipment are trusted by all professions. Expert carpenters
    also have the understanding of specialized oil coatings, imbuing their creations
    with special material qualities. In every community, these artisans are known
    to be indispensable building blocks of society who work tirelessly to push civilization
    forward, one nail at a time.
  requirements: []
  guide: The carpenter is a crafting class that performs like a striker in combat.
    With Hammer and Nail, you get the option to do guaranteed damage at the cost of
    some RP and mana pretty frequently. Useful for ensuring you can finish of weakened
    enemies. Felling Strike may look like a normal knockback move, but you get to
    move before doing the knockback, which lets you more easily do things like push
    enemies of ledges or knock an enemy back into your team. Repair Wood Weapon is
    a simple repair ability. In the zone is a crafting ability that you want to use
    as late as possible. If you're not using another finishing move such as Standard
    Finish, it's best to always save it for the last dice. Gains more value the higher
    quality materials you use, as each extra dice you add to the total gives a +1.
