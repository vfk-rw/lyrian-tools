  description: Snipers are expert marksmen that use sniper rifles to devastating effect.
  requirements:
  - Marksman mastered.
  guide: The sniper uses sniper rifles to fire at enemies from far beyond a range
    in which they can counter. It will be rare to get these extreme range fight, but
    you should always look to play as far back as possible. Ideally, you want to move
    as little as possible to get the accuracy bonus from Snipe. Positioning well early
    in the fight will keep paying off as it goes on. Penetrating Shot allows you to
    remain stationary without having to care about the cover the enemy has. Check
    with the GM if their cover can be penetrated before using it. With Concealed Shot,
    you are able to keep entering stealth after firing make your attacks impossible
    to react to. The RP cost may not be an issue either as long as you can stay far
    enough away from the fighting that you do not take counterattacks. Aimed Shot
    is a lock-on Heavy attack that can punish dodge users. Stealthed attacks can do
    the same, but you won't alway have that option. Killshot is the opening move of
    the sniper, provided you are able to remain hidden from the enemies before the
    fight starts. Normally high AP abilities do not gain the benefit of being a hidden
    attacker, but Killshot is an exception to this if used in the first round. This
    lets a sniper do huge damage right from the start. You can combine it with the
    ranger's guided aim ability for an almost certain hit that cannot be reacted to
    in any way.
