  description: Wielders of the shinigami eyes, rare as they are, have the ability
    to perceive the death of living things. For most of them, that is where it ends.
    However, there are those who over time grow an even deeper understanding of death.
    They can see the death not just of living things, but also of objects and even
    non-physical things such as magic. This enhanced perception has given those wielders
    the name of the ‘True Shinigami Eyes’.
  requirements:
  - Shinigami Eyes mastered.
  guide: 'Wielders of the True Shinigami Eyes bring some personal defense and utility
    to the table. Failing a save can be devastating, but Cut Away gives them an extremely
    high chance to succeed as most of them possess high Focus. The high focus also
    helps them with Cut Magic, allowing them to potentially break barriers and other
    magic effects at little cost. Barriers are the most obvious thing, but even things
    like Glittershards are considered temporary magic effects. Point of Death II is
    an upgrade of the original Point of Death ability. Its primary use is to finish
    off high toughness enemies, but the AP refund makes it a tempting choice against
    any weak foe. Their key ability allows them to kill non-living things as well
    as they do living things, and lets them build up marks for their ultimate ability:
    7 Points of Death. This Climax Art grows in power the more they attack a single
    target. It takes several turns to build up and must be used against a weakened
    enemy, but it has high damage potential. Similar to their previous Secret Art,
    the damage is static so you know what to expect even if there’s a small risk of
    missing.'
