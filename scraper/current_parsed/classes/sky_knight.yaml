  description: As was common with most innovations that made radical leaps, the history
    of the Sky Knights was steeped in warfare. Like the development of the Cavalier,
    learning to take to the sky on the backs of winged mounts stemmed from a need
    to counter a threat. Aerial Mages from Sorthen had long since, and in some cases
    continue, dominated the skies as scouts, couriers, and as untouchable bombardment
    specialists. With no modern airships to deter them and no Aeromancers to threaten
    them, both Northi and Westria searched for a solution. Nearly simultaneously,
    the two countries developed their own methods. From the mountains and hills near
    Mount Merlin, Northi tamed the wild pegasi. Harpy hunters were the first to capture
    and tame the wild flying horses and harpy run ranches continue to produce the
    highest quality mounts with specialized breeds tailored for various tasks. A pegasus’s
    agility and speed in the air let the chimeran knights of Northi put up a challenge
    to Sorthen aerial units in terms of scouting, but their limited endurance and
    fragile wings made them less suited as couriers and frontline combatants. Westria
    took a nuisance that plagued their southeastern border along the mountains near
    Jav and turned it into a solution. Wyverns roosting in the mountains and forests
    were regularly dealt with by adventurers and knights but some enterprising (and
    foolhardy) beast tamers decided to attempt to tame newly hatched wyverns as companions.
    With some false starts, they succeeded and it wasn’t long before an interest in
    training them as mounts emerged. Slower and less nimble in the air than their
    pegasi counterparts, a wyvern’s thick scales and devastating Reginleiv made them
    much more suitable as flying heavy cavalry. To this day, there is little overlap
    in the Sky Knight forces of Northi and Westria. While each side failed to deploy
    units that could directly counter Aerial Mages, their arrival on the battlefield
    removed Sorthen’s complete dominance of the air. Modern Sky Knight adventurers
    utilize whatever type of mount that suits their style (or that they can afford)
    and continue to fill their historical roles as scouts, couriers, and aerial cavalry.
  requirements:
  - Cavalier mastered.
  guide: 'The sky knight is a class that focuses on flying mounts. It is vulnerable
    to ranged attacks, but it has excellent target access. Despite being a tier 2
    class, it may not be accessible for everyone due to the high cost of pegasi and
    wyverns. A pegasus is faster, but wyverns are a lot more durable and with some
    offensive power. Air Stability helps manage the durability issues of the pegasus,
    allowing you to re-direct attacks like normal. The flight rules of you losing
    altitude still apply though. Aerial Loop can also help with this. It can be used
    if either you or your mount become the target and it affects both of you, useful
    for avoiding AoE attacks. Aerial Crashdown is your main tool of attacking the
    backline, moving you to the target and allowing your mount to make a heavy attack
    for just 2 AP. Be careful of getting stuck on the ground against melee enemies
    however, as you can''t canter of your mounts attack. If you don''t want to commit
    to an engagement, you can use Flyby attack. This, like Aerial Crashdown, also
    works with Trample, though getting trample value is harder with a flying mount.
    Your Secret Art: Mythical Awakening varies based on the type of flying mount you
    use. The pegasus one can be used both offensively to just deal damage, but also
    defensively if you''re scared of being forced to the ground by arrows. You can
    just bellorophon to attack and move low enough that you won''t get shot down.
    The wyvern''s reginliev is best used on the same elevation as the enemy, as it
    will be hard to hit many targets with the line attack otherwise.'
