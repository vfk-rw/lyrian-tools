  description: 'It was difficult to pin down the origins of anything throughout history.
    Plenty of ideas and methods were known to crop up simultaneously among completely
    isolated groups by simple happenstance. However, it was largely accepted that
    the idea of modern cavalry began with the arrival of nomadic human tribes from
    the north east of Lyr. Masters of their stocky, resilient horses, they migrated
    south west out of the tundra and steppe due to extremely harsh seasons and famine.
    Forced to avoid the forests of Easter to the south and pushed away from the budding
    kingdoms in Northi to the west, the nomadic humans settled in the lush plains
    of Axia and Nuren. Their art of mounted archery gave them unparalleled hunting
    abilities and made them maddeningly difficult to chase down, even from the fleet
    footed catfolk and rabbitfolk. For a time, the Nomads roamed plains, breeding
    ever stronger horses and leading a relatively simple life. They didn’t know that
    their presence forced the kingdoms of Northi to push their influence west into
    Susururu Forest, displacing wolf-folk and lamiafolk, and to the selkies of Houkaina
    on the coast. But eventually, with nowhere to continue expanding aside from the
    frigid north, Northi returned its attention to the plains. Utilizing enslaved
    centaurs as mounts, the catfolk hoped to narrow the mobility gap and to be able
    to finally hunt down the annoying humans. But without any static settlements and
    their mastery of the plains, the Nomads were still able to control the pace of
    any battles or hunts. Simultaneous to the more concentrated efforts from Northi,
    humans from Westria began to treat with the nomadic tribes of the Nuren Plains.
    They traded for horses, for trainers, and offered riches beyond the nomadic tribes’
    wildest dreams for empty land. Northi wasn’t alone in dreaming of securing the
    plains for their potential wealth of farmland, but the humans from the south recognized
    that the Nomads had completely stalled chimeran expansion with their mastery of
    horses and Westria had long been praying for something that would let them protect
    themselves from the chimera and fae. Humans had a long history of domesticating
    animals to help balance the strengths of their neighbors: dogs for hunting, oxen
    for burden…the introduction of horses was simply another method to overcome their
    weaknesses. With a combination of various deals with the nomads and utilizing
    their own methods against them, Westria was finally able to push its borders to
    the edge of the forest and the Nuren River. Their actions unfortunately displaced
    or eradicated tribes of nomads that resisted the territorial grab. Some historians
    believe that ancient, bad blood was one of the larger factors for the rise of
    independent nations along Westria’s north eastern border. Many humans from the
    plains regions could still claim ancestors from those nomadic tribes and while
    there was no official animosity, some were convinced there was an overarching
    reason they had carved out their independence from both Northi and Westria.'

  - Cavalier mastered.
  guide: 'The nomad is a ranged cavalry class that can be nearly impossible to catch.
    As a nomad, you excel in fights where you have a lot of space to run around it.
    Your light cavalry key ability makes you able to fight at maximum potential even
    in terrain that would normally be unfavorable for you, allowing you to keep your
    full mobility. Hit & Run is an ability that can either be used with a melee or
    ranged weapon. With a melee weapon, it does provoke an attack but it lets you
    move away from the enemy while dealing damage. With a ranged weapon it allows
    an essentialy free reposition and enables you to keep your distance from the enemy.
    It also allows you to use Running Shot. Runing Shot is a 1 RP cost ability that
    lets you make a Heavy attack. It does require you to move before you can use it,
    but Nomad has several ways of doing that. The RP cost is normally a big risk for
    a character to spend on offensive abilities, but as a nomad you have enough mobility
    and range that you can afford to spend some of it on doing more damage. Trailblazer
    is an utility ability that helps your allies get across difficult terrain. It
    can also be used to help them get into the fray faster, though it does cost them
    some RP. Your Secret Art: Chase the Horizon is the ultimate kiting tool against
    a single enemy. It has a steep mana cost for the duration, but it ensures the
    target you pick cannot catch you while its active and you can punish them if they
    do move. It''s best used when kiting a boss or when a melee enemy is far away
    from anything to attack. If they are forced to spend 4 AP on movement to do anything,
    then you get 4 attacks which is not bad for the cost.'
