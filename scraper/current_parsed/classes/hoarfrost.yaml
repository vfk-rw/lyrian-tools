  description: The Hoarfrosts are Cryomancers who’ve mastered the chilling power of
    ice, tracing their origins back to a legendary mage named Mirane. She was the
    first to truly perfect the art of Cryomancy during her journey through the eastern
    Tundra. Her story took a dramatic turn when she faced off against a powerful Fiend.
    In that intense battle, Mirane developed her ultimate spell, the Eternal Mirane
    Cage. This incredible spell froze the Fiend in place for ten long years, giving
    an army of adventurers the time they needed to arrive and finally take it down.
    Mirane’s magic didn’t just fade into history—it’s been passed down through the
    generations to future Hoarfrosts. Those who follow in her footsteps wear a snowflake
    emblem, just like Mirane did, and many of them embark on their own journeys to
    the Tundra that now bears her name.
  requirements:
  - Cryomancer mastered.
  guide: Eternal Mirane Cage is a legendary ability, but it’s not something you’ll
    use all the time. It’s perfect for when you need to subdue enemies who just won’t
    give up, making Hoarfrosts a great choice for missions where taking down targets
    alive is the goal. Frost Driver is an excellent follow-up move that turns a slow
    into a full-on root, setting up your team for devastating AoE attacks and utility
    plays. Just be aware of its limitation against flying enemies—it won’t be as effective
    there. White Thunder is a clever setup move that transforms your Glacial Walls
    into potential bombs. It forces enemies to think twice before getting too close,
    giving you control over the battlefield. When things get dicey, Glacial Bastion
    is your panic button, but it’s not something to use without thought. While it
    shields you, it can also give enemies the chance to position themselves around
    you, potentially trapping you. If you see them making a move for a big strike,
    use White Thunder while encased, since you can’t defend yourself while you’re
    in the ice. Lastly, the Hoarfrost’s Secret Art, Whiteout, is a powerful tool that
    reduces accuracy for everyone on the battlefield and can be activated right at
    the start of an encounter. It’s especially useful if you’re ambushed or under
    heavy pressure, buying your team some defensive turns to regroup and reposition.
    Just keep in mind that enemies with Frost Immunity or Ice Cold are unaffected
    by it, just like you.
