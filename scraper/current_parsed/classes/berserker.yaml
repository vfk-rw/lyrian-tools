    in exchange for more offense.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered.
  guide: Berserkers are highly aggresive fighters that rely on allies to keep them
    alive. They are centered around their rage stance, which gives them 2 bonus AP
    in exchange for disabling RP abilities. A person without RP is extremely vulnerable,
    so you will need allies to cast thing like the acolyte's Angel's Embrace on you
    for protection. Alternatively, you can wait with using it until you are have burned
    through some RP already. You will lose out on some power, but it may be better
    than going down. Both Break Free and Fallen Friend fit the playstyle of waiting
    with Rage Stance instead of using it immediately. Break Free especially is powerful
    against enemies with heavy CC effects. Into the fray is a gap closer that lets
    you approach an enemy without spending AP, allowing for a maximum amount of attacks
    after. The RP cost makes it so its best used when already in rage stance where
    your RP is less useful. The same applies to Reckless Strike. Normally trading
    1 RP for 1 AP is not worth it, but when you can't use your RP anyway, it is a
    good way to get some extra damage in.
