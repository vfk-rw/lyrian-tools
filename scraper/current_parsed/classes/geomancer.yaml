  guide: 'A Geomancer is a controller that uses shapes the battlefield to their benefit.
    Fissure is their main control spell that creates a large hole in the ground that
    enemies will have to get out of. This can be powerful when combined with other
    tools such as a Flame Oil Flask. People at the edges may step out of the fissure
    by spending an RP, but then you have the option of hitting them with a Seismic
    Shove. Seismic Shove is a unique forced movement ability in that it lets you push
    an enemy in any direction, instead of only backwards. If you hit an enemy with
    it, you can toss them into the Fissure they just avoided. Mud Wall is another
    area control spell that you can use. You can spend AP on it to either build cover
    for yourself and your allies, or create a small patch of difficult terrain for
    the enemies. When used a reaction, you can use the cover creating part of it to
    turn a potential hit into a miss or use it to make an enemy be unable to reach
    your allies. You can also use it in combination with the Fissure ability to create
    a sudden wall for when an enemy attempts to jump out of the hole. Secret Art:
    Earthquake is a wide hitting spell that does low damage, but knocks enemies prone.
    Its main strength is the extremely long range on it and the bonus damage it does
    against magically created objects. The last part may not come up often, but it
    will be devastating when it does. Be aware that it will also destroy your own
    mud walls. Finally, Tremorsense is a simple spell that lets you temporarily become
    aware of creatures. Useful for spotting out potential assassins, but it can also
    let you do things like position a fissure through a wall.'
