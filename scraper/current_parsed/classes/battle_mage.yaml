  description: There was once a time when pure, unbridled magic was the most powerful
    force in the land. A single mage could hold off entire enemy battalions with ease.
    But that changed with the invention of Artificing. Suddenly, battles began to
    shift, with more and more fighters targeting mages directly, exploiting their
    difficulty in close combat. As the martial world integrated rapid uses of internal
    mana and artifices, mages found themselves on the defensive, facing enemies up
    close like never before. In response to this new threat, the first Battle Mages
    emerged from Northi. These warriors developed a unique spell weave, while incredibly
    mana-intensive, it allowed them to cast spells rapidly, even in the heat of close-range
    combat. This innovation took full advantage of their physical prowess as Chimera,
    turning them into formidable opponents both near and far. The invention of the
    "Shooting Form" further enhanced their capabilities. This technique allowed Battle
    Mages to imbue their melee weapons with the properties of staves, enabling a seamless
    transition between long-range spellcasting and close-quarters combat. With this
    versatility, Battle Mages became a force to be reckoned with, combining the raw
    power of magic with the physicality of martial arts.
  requirements:
  - Have at least 1 spell
  - Be proficient in at least 1 melee weapon.
  guide: The battlemage is a competent switch striker, being able to swap between
    melee and ranged combat instantly. Weapon Swap has no cost and can be used even
    on an enemies turn, allowing you to swap to melee form if an enemy thinks he can
    just walk away. Mage Armor gives a lot of flexibility which is normally unavailable.
    When fighting a horde of weak monsters, you can start in heavy armor and watch
    their attacks bounce off almost harmlessly. Against a hard hiting boss, starting
    in light for maximum evasion might be better. If you made a mistake or the situation
    changes, a 2 AP cost is an acceptable price to pay for a change. Your RP changes
    as well, so starting in heavy armor and then moving to lighter armor as the fight
    progresses is a valid strategy. Dragon Breaks The Ranks is a long range gap closer
    that moves you forward with devastating force. The high AP cost may make it hard
    to use, but don't overlook the AoE damage part of the charge. It can also be used
    to escape from a tough situation as it gives flight, lots of movement and you
    don't provoke, provided you have a target you can charge to. Because the battle
    mage wants to spend time in melee combat, battle cast is a necessity to be able
    to cast spells without putting yourself at risk. Circle Swing is their main melee
    attack. It allows you to create space and follow up with a cheaper spell or ranged
    attack. Be aware that you may still provoke attacks from other enemies you are
    engaged with, even if you main target is now unable to. The most common weapon
    for a battle mage is a polearm. The extra range on attacks makes it easier for
    it to weave melee and spells without provoking.
