    targets with deadly accuracy and speed.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered.
  guide: 'The gunslinger takes control of the fight from the start with their Quickdraw
    ability. It''s only a light attack, but it''s a free attack that can''t be reacted
    to, so it''s free early damage. Because it''s an encounter start ability, it is
    one of the few things that lets you act before enemy with ‘First Shot’ initiative
    bonus can take their action. Ricochet is a simple attack that can be used to bypass
    light cover. If an enemy is using light cover, there''s little reason not to use
    it. Warning Shot costs a fair bit of mana, but gaining Trick Attack can help you
    secure hits. Grunts are unable to react to them, so you can snipe one hiding behind
    cover with a warning shot + ricochet combo. For their Secret Art: Fan the hammer
    you''ll probably want to bring a spare pistol. It is a relatively close range
    ability and the high AP cost makes it hard to move and shoot if you don''t get
    extra AP from somewhere, but it can do a large amount of damage. A single reaction
    will affect all 4 shots, so its something only to be used against a target that
    has exhausted their RP.'
