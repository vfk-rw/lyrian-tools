  description: Vampires are those who are cursed, using their cursed abilities to
    their advantage.
  requirements:
  - Must have the Curse of Vampirism breakthrough.
  guide: Vampires are a versatile class with a slight focus on unarmed combat. Vampire
    Bite is the only way that vampires can regenerate mana and using it whenever possible
    is required to keep your mana high. The high AP cost makes it hard to use in a
    straight up battle. You can combine it with Vampiric Fascination to remove one
    enemy from the battle. The chosen target will move towards you and you can easily
    follow it up with your bite on the next turn, dealing guaranteed full pierce damage.
    Action economy wise, this is still not very efficient though. In harder fights,
    it may be more worthwhile to fight normally at the start and only start looking
    for enemies to drain near the end of a fight. Cloak of Bats is a manaless teleport
    that can also be used offensively. The RP cost on it is higher than that of a
    basic defense, but the teleport lets you potentially avoid attacks that are undodgeable.
    Whether you're stuck in bad terrain, about to get hit by an AoE effect or you
    need to get behind cover, Cloak of Bats will get you out of almost any bad situation.
    Blood Frenzy is your last resort move. While it lasts you become very difficult
    to kill, especially if enemies are low on RP and can't avoid your attacks to prevent
    you from regaining health. It does however, lock you into a very specific set
    of actions. You can't regain mana through vampire bite or switch to a ranged weapon
    to hit an enemy that's far away. You also cannot turn it off manually, which may
    lead you to losing all your mana even when you no longer need the healing effect.
    This is especially devastating for a vampire, since mana regeneration is a problem
    for them. Vampire Shapeshift is a cheap utility tool that can be useful for infiltration
    and sneaking. Shapeshifting into a bat is also an easy way to gain access to flight
    to reach high ground. The last thing to keep in mind as a vampire is that your
    vampire bite is not just a combat ability. You are able to use it on willing targets
    without hurting them, though they still lose mana. You will have to convince them
    first though, someone charmed by Vampiric Fascination does not count as a willing
    person.
