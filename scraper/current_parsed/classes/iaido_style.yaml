  description: The art of Iai came from the Island of Kirara, a sword style utilizing
    Kiraran blades. The Youkai were known for their highly lethal speed and technique
    in preference over raw power. Iaidoka are quite rare, students of elusive Kiraran
    Masters who only train two students at a time.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered. Proficient with Katana.
  guide: 'Masters of the Iaido style typically start the battle in one of two ways:
    They open with an Iai strike or wait for the enemy to strike, then counter with
    Uke Nagashi. Iaido centers around Iaijutsu and the sheathed state. Their most
    important abilities are locked behind this sheathed state and unless you fulfill
    conditions, its a once per battle thing. Iai Strike is a powerful attack that
    not only has lock-on, it''s also only 1 AP. Unless you are using a weapon other
    than a katana and mixing weapon fighting styles, this will most likely be your
    first action in combat. Because using it loses the sheathed state, it can not
    be used again unless you use Kiri-tsuke. Kiri-tsuke is a heavy attack with the
    benefit of resetting your sheathed state when you score a kill with it. Depending
    on the battle, this may be an easy or hard thing to do, but you should always
    look for the opportunity for the reset. Chiburi Noto is used at the end of the
    encounter and buffs you for your next one by maximizing your Iai strike damage.
    The benefit of this can be good, but if you are low on HP or mana it may be wise
    to use one of the basic options instead. Uke Nagashi is a powerful counter move
    that has the condition that you must still be in the sheathed state. Because making
    any attack with a katana removes the sheathed state, this means you can not attack
    before using Uke Nagashi, unless you use a different weapon. This is a valid option.
    You can choose to attack with a normal sword, then drop it and prepare for your
    counter. If you''d rather only use a katana and still want to use this, then you
    can instead play very aggressive with your positioning. Use all your AP to move
    up, then when the enemy wants to attack you, unleash the counter. You can also
    choose to delay and hope the enemy moves up and attacks you.'
