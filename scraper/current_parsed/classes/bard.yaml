  description: Bards are the storytellers, entertainers, and actors of the world,
    hailing from all sorts of disciplines. Whether they're performing in a bustling
    tavern for a handful of tips or captivating a crowd in the town square, Bards
    bring life and joy wherever they go. They're the ones who immortalize the tales
    of adventuring parties, ensuring that no deed, whether noble or notorious, goes
    unheard. In a party, Bards play a crucial role by inspiring their allies to achieve
    greatness. With their music, they can lift spirits and hype up their companions,
    turning the tide of battle with a well-timed tune.
  requirements:
  - Have at least 5 skill points in the Art (Singing) expertise or at least 5 points
    in an Art expertise of an instrument.
  guide: The bard is a support class primarily focused around their Inspiring Song
    and Dirge of Despair. Inspiring Song gives every ally a 1d4 bonus to a roll once
    per round. It may not seem much, but it can be used to push a barely missed attack
    into hitting. Dirge of Despair is the opposite, affecting enemies instead. Due
    to allowing a save, it's a bit less reliable but a lot of fights may have more
    enemies than allies on the battlefield. Because both of these are songs and cannot
    be used at the same time, the bard has to choose which one they want to use. In
    general, Inspiring Song is more offensive while Dirge of Despair is a more defensive
    song. Their other support ability is Siren Song. It also cannot be used with the
    other two songs, but it can be a powerful CC against grunts. Because they spend
    the AP on their turn, their movement provokes attacks of opportunities and even
    if they are broken free, their spent AP remains lost. Their last combat ability
    is Shatter, which is a good follow up after luring enemies closer with Siren Song.
    The AP cost makes it usable even when keeping up Inspiring Song or Dirge of Despair
    as well.
