  guide: The Onmyoji is a utility class that focuses on using talismans, scrolls or
    similar items. They can either create their own or use those created by others.
    Buying talismans from others is an excellent way to increase your versatility
    in combat or plug the gaps in your party composition. Create Talisman lets you
    make your own talismans. The main benefit of this is that it lets you prepare
    expensive spells in advance, allowing you to pay the mana cost at a point where
    you don't care about it instead of in the middle of combat. You can also possibly
    prepare certain buff spells for your allies, though they will have to pay the
    mana cost again themselves if they aren't also an Onmyoji. Secret Talisman is
    an ability that just lets you use a Secret Art that's on a talisman. Secret Arts
    are normally limited to once per encounter, so being able to use two can be quite
    the power boost. Sealing Talisman is a powerful CC, but it comes at the cost of
    having to prepare the talisman beforehand. Grunts have little counterplay against
    it, but even against heroics you can force them to waste quite a bit of AP for
    no AP cost of your own. Preparedness gives you a bit more flexibility and options
    in what you can bring. Overall, Onmyoji is very reliant on either outside sources
    of talismans or in having strong classes to complement it to really shine. It
    is not recommended to take the class without taking some other classes beforehand
    or having a clear goal in mind.
