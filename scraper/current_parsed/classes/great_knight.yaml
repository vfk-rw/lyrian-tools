  description: 'First fielded by Northi not long after Hussars were becoming common
    on the battlefield, the Great Knight represented the quintessential heavy cavalry.
    With knight and mount both clad in heavy armor, the Great Knight was made to be
    a mobile barrier. Able to interpose their armored bulk for their allies and even
    project that protection into an aura around them, Great Knights were able to push
    through even the most heavily contested battlefields for their allies. And while
    there were countless stories throughout the ages of heavily armored knights turning
    the tides of battle, there were none as debated as the story of Sir Owain Morgan
    and Dame Madeline Benoit. As told and accepted by Northi historians, Sir Owain
    Morgan was a dogfolk Great Knight without peer. Honorable beyond reproach and
    an unstoppable juggernaut on the battlefield, he had a list of successful battles
    attributed to him that stretched the imagination. In fact, detractors of Sir Owain’s
    tale would often point out that he must have surely known teleportation and time
    travel magics to be at so many battles at once. What could not be disputed was
    that Sir Owain certainly existed, his name recorded in the annals of the Bastion
    Knights. But his most debated feat was one that involved a Westrian knight, Dame
    Madeline Benoit, and the proliferation of Mage Knights into Northi’s military.
    While there were many versions of the tale, the most accepted one in Northi followed
    a series of reasonably set in stone facts. During one of the many border skirmishes
    common between Northi and Westria as they vied for control over the Nuren Plains,
    it was said that Sir Owain led a counter attack against a Westrian skirmishing
    force. He led his men to victory and successfully captured many knights to ransom
    back to Westria, including Dame Madeline Benoit. While most of the knights and
    men at arms were released back to their homes, Dame Madeline was kept for one
    very important reason: to teach Northi the art of the Mage Knight. Historians
    for the Era of Knights could often be incited into argument around the idea as
    there were as many accounts for how Northi gained access to the skills of Westria’s
    holy knights as there were historians to argue about them. But what was almost
    universally accepted as the truth was that Sir Owain, disgusted with his peers
    and superiors'' lack of any decency to release Dame Madeline back to her family,
    took it upon himself to free the woman. There was little historical accounting
    of where they went or what they did but there were legends of a pair of knights
    wandering Lyr and helping those in need. And while those actions had never definitively
    been attributed to Sir Owain and Dame Madeline, what couldn’t be denied was when
    they both turned back up in solid historical record. They would found Morgan Ranch
    in what would later become Dacquoise, near the future site of the city of Madeline.
    It was there that the retired knights, happily married for an unclear amount of
    time, had begun taking on students and ranch hands to teach the art of horsemanship,
    knighthood, and magic. While the ranch itself did not last into modern times,
    the house itself was maintained and the legacy of chivalry was upheld by the descendants
    of those students. Collectively, and informally, they called themselves the Knights
    of Morgan and dedicated themselves to helping those in need whenever and wherever
    they were found.'

  guide: 'The great knight is a mounted tank class that excels in fights with many
    different engagements. Intercept is your main tool in getting around the battlefield,
    allowing you to ride to an allies aid. If you move to an ally far away enough,
    you can even use Trample and do some damage with it. Note that your movement is
    not a sidestep, you do provoke attacks of opportunity with it. Rescue & Drop lets
    you save an ally from a bad situation and ride them out to safety. You can also
    drop them immediately to another square nearby to break them free from being surrounded
    or to let them move away without provoking. Your Secret Art: Moving Castle is
    an aura that reduces damage by 3 in a small aura around you. This can be massive
    when fighting against a group of non-heroic enemies, reducing the damage your
    allies take by a large amount. You can also move for free once per turn to reposition
    and potentially help allies in two completely different positions at the same
    time. Shared Defense is a simple tool that helps you protect your mount from AoE
    attacks.'
