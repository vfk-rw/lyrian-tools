  description: A warrior with peerless skill in swordsmanship.
  requirements:
  - Iaido style mastered.
  guide: 'The Sword Saint has further mastered Iaido. Resheathe allows them to regain
    the Sheathed state during combat without relying on a kiri-tsuke killing blow.
    The AP cost is high though and it should only be used during a lull in combat.
    Kiri-tsuke II is an upgrade from the normal kiri-tsuke that combos of Iai strike,
    saving you some AP. Chiburi Noto II is also a straight upgrade from Chiburi Noto,
    adding full pierce on top of the previous benefit. Flash Cut is a mana intensive
    attack that does unavoidable heavy damage. It requires you to be in the sheathed
    state, which makes it only really an option in the beginning of the fight. Flash
    Cut into Iai strike into Kiri-tsuke II is a very dangerous combo. The Secret Art:
    Tsubame Gaeshi has high potential damage, but also does some guaranteed damage.
    You are guaranteed at least 1 hit, most likely a second and a third if you''re
    lucky or if the target is out of RP. You can use this even early in the fight,
    especially if you''ve already softened up an enemy through your other attacks
    with sure hit and lock on.'
