  description: A supportive wind user that can protect against and help with ranged
    attacks.
  requirements:
  - Mage mastered or Wind mastered.
  guide: The Zephyr Warder specializes in ranged combat, helping both allies hit targets
    and preventing enemy archers from hitting. Wind Infusion can be cast on every
    ally over the course of a battle and gives them not only an evasion bonus against
    ranged attacks, but also damage resistance against wind attacks. Worth using immediately
    when facing those types of enemies. Wind Shield completely shuts down an enemy
    ranged attack, granting your ally such a huge bonus along with removing the lock-on
    and sure hit that the attack is sure to miss. Wind Wall has to be cast in advance,
    but it can cover a wide chokepoint and removes all keywords that lets them ignore
    Dodge or Block. The range decrease can also matter a lot, especially if enemies
    are only using light ranged weapons. The mana cost isn't too bad either. Wind-Empowered
    Aim buffs all your (heroic) ranged allies, giving a decent bonus to their accuracy
    rolls. Worth using if you have a lot of ranged attackers in your party or if you
    get into a shootout. With this buffs and all the anti-ranged buffs you have, you're
    sure to win a shooting battle.
