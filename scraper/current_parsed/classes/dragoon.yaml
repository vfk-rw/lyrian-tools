  description: Dragoons are a high mobility class that can fight at great heights
    without risk.
  requirements:
  - Lancer mastered
  - 10 Points in the Athletics (Jumping) expertise skill.
  guide: 'Dragoons excel at fighting at heights. They do not need to worry about fall
    damage when using their dragoon abilities and can turn it into damage for them
    by using Skydive. When not fighting on an airship or something else that flies,
    Dragoons can use buildings or trees to gain the height advantage. If there is
    nothing else around, Jump can be used. It is a decent initiation option, though
    Jump is often better used to reposition or escape from a bad situation than pure
    initiation. Dragonfire Dive is a powerful AoE tool that puts you in range to follow
    up with more attacks right after. Jump Back is an ability that allows the dragoon
    to perform hit and run attacks. You can engage, then jump back to force enemies
    to waste their movement in coming to you. When fighting in the air, you can jump
    on an enemy, kill it, then jump back to your airship. There''s a lot of possibilities,
    just keep in mind that it has to be used directly after a Jump ability. Don''t
    stick around for too long, or you aren''t able to get back. Their Secret Art:
    Dragonslaying Jump is what makes them masters of aerial combat. It is effectively
    a guaranteed heavy hit on a flying target that forces them to the ground. Against
    a target that is flying high above the ground, this last part can easily be fatal.'
