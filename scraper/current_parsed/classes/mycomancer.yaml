  description: Mycomancers are powerful mages that harness the power of fungi to heal
    allies and destroy enemies. They try to understand death through mycology.
  requirements:
  - Mage mastered or Earth Mastery
  guide: Mycomancers are a unique healer that relies on dealing damage to heal their
    allies. The only target they can heal is their Spore Symbiote. Once it is placed,
    you can use Saprophytic Bolt to heal your target. Grunts may react to it even
    if its a light attack, so burning their RP first may be advised so you don't waste
    it. Destroying Angel is a bigger heal and also comes with the benefit of instantly
    killing the target when used against grunts. It is not worth using against non-grunts
    however. Poison Spore is the last ability that can center around the spore symbiote.
    It can be used as a zoning tool of sorts, but be aware that your allies are not
    immune to the poison. One of the better uses is placing it around yourself or
    the symbiote if they are a more vulnerable target and using the spore as a deterrent
    to any assassin type enemies that might threaten the backline. Amoxicillin is
    a simple disease removal spell. The cast time makes it unusable in battle and
    you are required to identify the disease first, but it's a free removal once you
    do. As a mycomancer, it is recommended you heal early rather than late. Your healing
    can be unreliable and you don't want your allies to drop low, only for you to
    miss a crucial a heal and watch them go down.
