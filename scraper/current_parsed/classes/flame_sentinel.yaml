  description: A supportive fire magic user that can buff their allies and zone away
    enemies.
  requirements:
  - Mage mastered or Fire mastery.
  guide: Flame Sentinels support their allies primarily through offense. Flame Weapon
    grants a small power boost to a weapon of an ally and lets them deal fire damage,
    which may be important against some enemies. Controlled Blaze will not prevent
    your allies from setting things on fire, so be careful when giving it out when
    flameable material is around. Flame Shield allows you to do damage after an ally
    takes damage. It costs 1 RP, but its fully unavoidable and full pierce damage.
    If you hang out in the back and don't have much use for your RP, this can be an
    excellent way to spend it. Flame Infusion is a situational ability. Against certain
    enemies it's extremely powerful and against others, its a detriment. Flame Wall
    is a strong zoning tool, able to cut off a large portion of a fight. You can also
    use it as a damage tool, dropping it right on top of enemies to force them to
    use an RP. If they choose not to do so, or if they have no more RP to spent, then
    it is effectively a Sure Hit attack once their turn starts.
