  description: A specialist in using throwing weapons.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered. Proficiency in throwing weapons.
  guide: The peltast makes throwing weapons a valid choice for a main weapon. The
    boomerang key ability makes it so you no longer have to keep paying AP to draw
    more weapons. The peltast ideally wants to play close to the enemy and isn't afraid
    of melee combat. Long Toss gives you a long range option. The range of throwing
    weapons is normally a bit low, so this can be used when you would be out of range
    to attack normally. Rappelling Dagger is a movement option that can also deal
    damage. Useful when you have to engage an enemy that's not too far away and it
    can be used to obtain high ground by rappelling into a tree or on top of a building.
    Fan of Knives is a point blank AoE that can be used even when engaged in melee.
    It will require you to get close to the enemy before you can use it. Stab & Throw
    is an AP efficient attack that requires you to be in melee, plus to have another
    enemy nearby.
