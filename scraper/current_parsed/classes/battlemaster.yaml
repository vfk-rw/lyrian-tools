  description: A versatile fighter that can use any weapon.
  requirements:
  - Fighter mastered.
  guide: The battlemaster is an expert in all weapons. If you find a good weapon,
    whether its an artifice, relic or even a divine arms, you will be able to use
    it to its maximum effect. You also don't need to worry about being unable to use
    certains attack with your new weapon due to the Unconventional Weapon ability.
    It has the potential for silly combos, such as using Iai while a greataxe. Being
    a master of battle, they posses ways to punish both Dodge and Guard focused characters.
    Skillful blow has lock-on to make it good against high agility where as Mordschlag's
    guard crush allows it to punish heavily armored enemies. Disarming Attack is their
    last ability and it can give them the edge in a duel against most martial enemies.
    If they forgot to bring a spare weapon, the disarm all but disables them for a
    turn.
