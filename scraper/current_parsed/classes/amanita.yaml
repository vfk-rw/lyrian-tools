  description: Amanita’s are expert Mycomancer’s that weave life and death hand in
    hand. Blessed healers to their allies and terrifying killers to their enemies,
    they were feared ever since the first Fae Amanita’s appeared amongst the ranks
    of Sylvan’s army. Amanita’s often wear mushroom caps on their head with spotted
    designs to signify their rank. The spores that reside within all Amanita’s blood
    also grants them considerable resilience against poison.
  requirements:
  - Mycomancer mastered.
  guide: Amanita’s expand on the Healer and Striker hybrid of the Mycomancer, specializing
    in supporting tanks while busting enemy tanks. Vital Drain and Hyphal Force are
    excellent tools for overcoming armor, while also keeping allies healthy. Spore
    burst is useful in a pinch when caught out of position. The Amanita also has the
    terrifying ability of keeping allies up while downed, giving them the ability
    to continue fighting. However, make sure to remind your allies that they are in
    risk of dying due to being able to fight at negative HP, as reaching negative
    maximum HP can kill a character.
