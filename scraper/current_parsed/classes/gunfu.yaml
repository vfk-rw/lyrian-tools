  description: A skilled gunner and martial artist that combines guns and martial
    arts into a deadly mix.
  requirements:
  - Martial Artist mastered
  - Gunslinger mastered.
  guide: Those who practice Gunfu are able to fight well from both range as well as
    in melee due to not suffering any penalties when firing in melee combat. They
    are able to weaken the enemy from range, then go in for the kill once theyâ€™ve
    come closer. Slide & Shoot is their gap closer that can be used to slip past the
    frontline to target the backline. It also starts their combo and should always
    be followed up with an unarmed attack for maximum value. Pistol Whip is counted
    as an unarmed attack and is thus a natural follow up that now costs 0 AP. The
    debuff it applies will help reduce the amount of attacks you face. After that,
    you can finish it up with a Point Blank Shot. It is not particularly effective
    against heavy armor, but it punishes dodgy characters extremely hard. Their Secret
    Art Whirling Death is an excellent clean up tool for grunt type enemies. Ideally
    it should be used when multiple enemies are already weakened. This will allow
    for multiple activations of its Killing Blow mechanic when you finish off the
    weak enemies and can keep shooting.
