  description: Shinigami Eyes are mystic eyes that allow the user to perceive the
    death of things. This manifests in the shape of lines and points on a creatureâ€™s
    body, which can be cut or stabbed.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered
  - must have the Touched by Death breakthrough.
  guide: 'The Shinigami Eyes are a mystic eye ability. When you activate your death
    perception, you immediately see the HP % of all enemies within sight. It may cost
    a mana, but it gives information a lot faster than relying on Status Assessment
    skills. With the True Death passive ability, you immediately become a counter
    to any sort of healer. There''s nothing to heal when their maximum HP is reduced
    by the same amount as their HP. Line of Death is a light attack that punishes
    armored targets that think they can ignore light attacks. It won''t do much extra
    against targets without a high guard. Point of Death does consistent damage against
    enemies below half HP. Even against targets without high guard, it may still be
    worth using sometimes for its maximum damage property when you need to secure
    a kill and can''t risk rolling low on damage. Secret Art: Seventeen Dissection
    is a secret art that does not cost any mana, making it usable in every fight.
    Against heroic enemies, it is just a guaranteed 17 damage. It can be useful if
    they are still sitting on RP but are low on HP. If they are out of RP, then just
    attacking normally may do more damage. Against any type of grunt, it is just an
    instant kill no matter. Useful against grunts that have a lot of hit points.'
