  description: Anti-mage is a discipline often pursued by those who don't practice
    magic themselves. With Mages playing such a critical role in boosting military
    power, it's often a top priority to neutralize them first. Thatâ€™s where Anti-Mages
    come in. They dedicate their studies to finding the cracks in all forms of magic,
    learning how to disrupt and cancel its effects. Anti-Mages have a deep understanding
    of magic, perhaps even more so than some Mages themselves. They don't just know
    how magic works, they know how to break it. A prime example of their power was
    seen during the 2nd Battle of Jav. A Demon Anti-Mage singlehandedly turned the
    tide at the east gate, neutralizing a line of magical smoke deployed by the Westrians.
    This critical move helped maintain the stalemate that Jav held for years, showcasing
    just how formidable Anti-Mages can be on the battlefield.

  guide: Anti-mages do well against mages as the name suggests. Dispel magic is a
    guaranteed removal of a magical effect that has many possible uses. Whether its
    buffs, control spells or debuffs, dispel magic can remove it all. If you know
    you're up against a mage that can shield themselves or allies, you can cast Anti-Shield
    on them. For many mages, shields are an important defense and Anti-Shield can
    be safely re-applied to them every turn to deny them this. If your allies are
    under fire by enemy mages, you can use Anti-Magic Shield on them. It gives them
    1 RP and reduces the damage they take on top of that. Counterspell can be gamechanging
    if used to counter an important spell. Though it has high potential, it also has
    a high RP cost. If you try to counterspell simple damage spells, you'll quickly
    find yourself running out. Save your RP and only use it to deny a spell the opposing
    mage absolutely needs to cast.
