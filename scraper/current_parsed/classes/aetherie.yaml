  description: 'The Four Swords War pushed the boundaries of artifice and magic in
    the way only a continent spanning conflict can. Entire schools of magic were created
    and artifice technology raced forward at breakneck speed. The Aetherie were but
    one of those desperate developments. Founded from the study of the genius work
    of a Lu Clan demon by Axian and Sorthen researchers, the brief life of the namesake
    of the magical discipline is inescapably entwined with the art of Mind Connection.
    Aetherie Lu’Pana earned her right as a master of magic in the middle of her own
    apprenticeship as the war with Westria and Northi pushed into Sorthen’s borders.
    After reading through the requests passed to her master for a method to counter
    or break through Northi artifice communications jamming, Aetherie offered up her
    own research project: a mind/mana connection technique. It didn’t take long after
    successfully demonstrating the new magic that her preliminary plans for an amplifying
    artifice was put into the prototype stage. She and the prototype were rushed toward
    the rapidly collapsing front where she was able to establish communications between
    General Ar’Golan and his battalion commanders, using herself as a conduit. This
    ability to coordinate in real time using the eyes of his own commanders allowed
    the Sorthen Rear Guard to briefly hold the invading armies at the Battle of Three
    Passes for the critical weeks needed for their remaining forces and critical civilians
    to be evacuated to Marlone. Unfortunately, the defense collapsed when Aetherie
    Lu’Pana, pushed beyond her limits by the strain of upkeeping her Mind Connection
    using the prototype sensory station, died from the strain. Her notes and the testimony
    of the one surviving commander from Three Passes that had been Mind Connected
    was studied carefully and the “Aetherie Mind Connect” school of magic was codified
    shortly after the war. Aetherie are a rare breed of mage. The mental fortitude
    required to process multiple viewpoints and even spread their influence out from
    those they’re connected with does not come easily and there are whispered stories
    of would-be Aetherie losing their minds in the ebb and flow of magic. But a well
    practiced Aetherie, with proper support and equipment, can bring unprecedented
    support and coordination to any group.'

  - Any class mastered.
  guide: The Aetherie is a long range utility and support class. While it can function
    at close range, the main draw is to use Mind Connection to set up a telepathic
    link and work off your allies while you remain somewhere else. This range is further
    boosted if you can afford the sensory mage suit, so you should invest in that
    if you plan to play this way. Psychometry is a free or almost free scouting ability
    that is very valuable in dungeons or other indoor explorations. It can let your
    party properly prepare before entering dangerous room. Conduit is what lets you
    use abilities from other classes while playing from long range. There are still
    some restrictions on what you can do, so picking classes that synergize well with
    this ability is important. Tap Cracker lets you open doors from a distance, which
    can be useful in avoiding traps. You can also unlock doors, allowing you to fulfill
    a niche without having to invest many skill points into it. Spirit Circuit Crash
    is a powerful ability that removes a targets ability to use mana without any roll
    or save. Because it doesn't have a mana cost, you can effectively keep a target
    from using a mana ability the entire fight unless they choose to take the damage.
    But be aware that not every enemy will have or use mana.
