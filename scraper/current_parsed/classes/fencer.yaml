  requirements:
  - Any class mastered.
  guide: The fencer is a highly mobile 1v1 specialist. Their fancy footwork allows
    them to reposition on the battlefield and away from other attackers, keeping them
    focused on their target. Parry is their most important ability. It costs 1 mana,
    but the RP cost is easily refunded if you use it against light attacks or against
    someone weaker than you. Because it effectively is a damage check with your focus
    instead of power, you should be careful in using it against high power enemies,
    especially if they use a heavy weapon. A heavy attack from those is likely to
    break through your parry and a dodge might be the better option. Riposte is the
    follow up to a parry. It costs 1 RP, so it does eat into your defenses but it
    is an otherwise free Heavy attack. Just keep your RP in mind before using it.
    Lunge helps fencer on fighting multiple enemies a bit. If an enemy is barely out
    of range, you can use your Lunge for extra range than fancy footwork to get in
    range. It can also be useful against rogueish characters who think they are safe
    after an evasive maneuver. Simply activate lunge and hit them from 10ft away.
    Precise Thrust is an attack that's best used against heavily armored targets.
    Dodging is usually the preferred answer to a Heavy attack, so this may not see
    much use except against the most armored of enemies.
