  guide: Blacksmith is a crafting class that creates weapons. A lot of your abilities
    and use will come during interlude phases where you can craft your weapons. Outside
    of crafting, you can use Forged Knowledge to boost the damage of an attack you
    made. It requires you to use a weapon you crafted yourself and you only maximize
    one dice, so use it when you are a few points of damage of from killing an enemy
    or to turn a 1 into a 6 or 8. With Weapon Maintenance, you give a weapon a +1
    bonus to damage or accuracy. It only costs an encounter start action, so there's
    no reason not to do it if you aren't using it for anything else. When crafting,
    Steady Craft II is better than rolling on average. You can delay using it to see
    if you need a higher number at the end before using it, but it will be better
    most of the time.
