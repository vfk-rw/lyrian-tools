  description: The first Aeromancer corps were born in Northi, created as a direct
    response to Sorthen's formidable Ace Aerial Mage squads. While the Catfolk had
    a stronghold on the ground with their incredible speed, the Fae and Sorthen flyers
    posed a constant threat from above. That is, until a cunning Catfolk mage named
    Nicole Mimi changed the game. Mimi took a magical art that was once considered
    weak, Aeromancy, and turned it into a force to be reckoned with. By destabilizing
    the air itself, she crafted powerful gales and sudden downbursts, effectively
    disrupting air superiority. What was once seen as a lesser magic became a devastating
    weapon under her mastery. To this day, Aeromancers from all corners of the world
    study Mimi's tomes, learning to command the sky just as she did. They've turned
    Aeromancy into an art of its own, capable of twisting the winds and reshaping
    the battlefield.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered or Wind mastered.
  guide: Aeromancers take on a more controllery striker role, displacing enemies while
    attacking them. They are very dangerous when near cliffs or other hazards. Their
    difficulty lies in the importance of their positioning. Knockbacks do damage if
    the target can not be moved the full distance, so knocking enemies into walls
    can add a decent amount of damage. Wind Blast is a low investment ability that
    provides significant displacement. While using it near hazards is the obvious
    choice, it can also be used to free up space for allies or to push the enemy closer
    to your allies so they can spend more AP on attacking instead of moving. Wind
    Scatter is an almost pure disruption tool. It makes further AoE's impossible,
    so careful use is required to not disrupt your allies. A good Wind Scatter however,
    can put significant distance between the front most and backmost enemy of a formation,
    which allows for targets to be isolated and picked off. Wind Buffet is a more
    defensive knockback, forcing enemies away from you. Be careful, as it provokes
    attacks of opportunities and can hit allies. Downburst is a simple, but extremely
    powerful anti-air tool. With high range and lock-on, an aeromancer is a aerial
    mage or flying monster's worst nightmare.
