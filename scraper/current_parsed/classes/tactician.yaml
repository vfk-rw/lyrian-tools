  description: Tacticians are capable battlefield commanders that augment their alliesâ€™
    natural abilities through tactical advance and organization.
  requirements:
  - Any class mastered
  - 5 skill points in the history skill.
  guide: 'The tactician is a support class that has a lot of mobility options. Stratagem:
    Lightning not only gives all your allies extra initiative, it also lets them move
    once for free. This is very useful if your part consists of primarily melee fighters.
    Order: Retreat is primarily meant to be a defensive tool, pulling an injured ally
    out of a bad situation. It can also be used offensively. You can move up towards
    the enemy and then Order: Retreat them closer to you and the enemy. Tag Rotation
    is useful in chokepoints. Let your first ally make attacks, then tag rotate to
    let your second melee fighter make their attacks. It can also be used when a weaker
    ally is about to be attacked to swap positions with a tank. Take Cover! is used
    in long range shootoffs. Turning your low cover into high cover will give your
    allies an edge in ranged battles. Attack in Detail is used against boss type enemies.
    The primary benefit is the +1 damage all your allies get against the target. It''s
    more useful if your allies use light attacks, due to more attacks gaining a benefit
    from the +1. It also is more useful the more allies you have. When you only have
    2 allies with you, the benefit of this ability might not be high enough vs just
    firing an attack yourself.'
