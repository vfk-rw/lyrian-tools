  requirements:
  - Alchemist mastered.
  guide: 'The Alchemeister is an alchemist that is more skilled at crafting and using
    the items they craft. Detailed Finish is a good final action when crafting, giving
    you a higher average at no cost. With Infuse Potion you are able to heal with
    potions without requiring your allies to drain their own mana, making you a lot
    more effective as a healer. You don''t have to use it every time either, allowing
    you to make others pay with their mana when yours is running low. With Counter-Potion
    you are able to use an alchemy item as a reaction, allowing you to do a variety
    of powerful things. You can toss a flashbang to interrupt an action by lowering
    their AP, toss a slowing flask when an enemy is about to approach your ally or
    toss a molly when they''ve finished moving to make them take guaranteed damage.
    Combine this with Quickdraw Alchemy from alchemist and you don''t even need to
    prepare this action in advance. At any point you can quickdraw what you need and
    toss it. Secret Art: All of Creation is a situational ability. Changing the damage
    type will not always be useful, but it can really help amplify damage dealt when
    against an enemy with a vulnerability or weakness. It is also completely free,
    apart from taking up your one secret art per encounter. Special Mention goes to
    Alchemist belonging to a race that can absorb a certain elemental damage, such
    as Salamander. A Salamander alchemist can force any big attack about to hit them
    to be fire damage, which they can easily absorb and turn into healing ofr themselves.'
