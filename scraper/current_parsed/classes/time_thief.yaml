  requirements:
  - Rogue mastered.
  guide: 'The time thief is a utility class that manipulates their own time to gain
    advantages. With Shatter Time, you can act multiple times in a turn. This can
    let you act after teammates when needed, act when an enemy has moved closer to
    you or enemies have positioned for an AoE or several other things. It doesn''t
    let you use an ability multiple times in a round though. Start Dash is a free
    movement, but it can only be used as the first action on your turn. This movement
    does provoke attacks of opportunity and you can''t disengage or feint before it,
    so you may want to evasive maneuver before your turn begins if you plan to use
    it while engaged in melee. Steal Time gives you a small boost to your initiative
    while lowering that of enemy. This may let your allies potentially act before
    the enemy does on subsequent turns. Secret Art: Rewind lets you do stupid things
    without being punished for it. You can potentially hit into enemy counters to
    see what happens, run past suspicious hallways that may be trapped, attempt dangerous
    jumps across a cliff. If the result is bad, you can simply rewind time and either
    try again or do something else entirely.'
