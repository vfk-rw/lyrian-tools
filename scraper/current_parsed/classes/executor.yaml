  guide: Executors are good against mages. Holy Orders gives them sticking power to
    a single target that is almost impossible to escape from. Because they can only
    attack a single target, it does mean they cannot threaten multiple backline threats
    by themselves. Sometimes, it may be worth foregoing the holy orders until later.
    Deus Vult can only be used against people who have Holy Orders on them. It allos
    the executor to trade an RP for an offensive boost, making for an attack that
    is hard to dodge. It also gains the shieldbreaker property, which can heavily
    punish mages. It is best used in combination with Ave Maria. It has a higher AP
    cost, so missing it is particularly bad which deus vult helps prevent. It can
    be worth tossing out against a target that has no RP left, especially if they
    have higher guard. It also does Holy damage, which may be relevant against some
    enemies. Eagle Hunt is what Executors use to get in range of their targets. They
    can leap over the frontline and land in the back. It may also be used as an escape
    tool or it can be seen as a cheap movement option if you are already planning
    to use Silentium, which gets a 1 AP discount when used during Eagle Hunt. Silentium
    is primarily used against mages, against who disabling their concentration can
    be devastating. It also disables their spells until they remove it, which can
    be seen as effectively lowering their RP or AP for the next turn. Use with Deus
    Vult when you absolutely need to cancel an ongoing spell they are concentrating
    on.
