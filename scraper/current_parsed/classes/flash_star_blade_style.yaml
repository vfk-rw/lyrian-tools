  requirements:

  - longsword or katana.
  guide: 'The Flash Star Style is a sword style originating from the Raijin that requires
    precise positioning. Photon Line moves you exactly 25ft, not up to 25ft. This
    can make it difficult to use against a single target, since you''ll often dash
    past the target and be unable to attack them without moving. Using it as a retreating
    option is a valid choice as you force the enemy to move to attack you. If you
    do manage to line up the perfect Photon Line on the offense, you can combo it
    into Thunderbolt Slash. Thunderbolt Slash is 3 light attacks for the cost of 2
    AP. With its mana cost reduced by the combo effect, it lines up perfectly for
    a 4 AP turn that doesn''t cost any mana. Starlight Crescent Reversal is a safe
    mana dump each turn, allowing for a cheap Light attack. The Secret Art: Twin Nova
    Pursuit is an engagement and isolation tool. You are able to move a target 25ft
    or 50ft, depending on how they react, which can let you get a 1v1 when you remove
    an enemy from a melee brawl. It can also be used to engage and knock an enemy
    into your own allies, allowing them to pile on without having to move and most
    likely dragging that enemy out of range of any support abilities.'
