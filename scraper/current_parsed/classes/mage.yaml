  description: Mages are initiates of the arcane, whoâ€™ve mastered the basics and proven
    their skill in both control and power. By drawing in ambient mana and blending
    it with their own, they can cast devastating spells of all kinds. The path of
    a Mage is as varied as the Mages themselves. Some might start off their journey
    at the Merlin's Academy of Magic, while others are self taught or might become
    the pupil of a wandering teacher. While still considered beginners in the journey
    of Magic, Mages are quite powerful on their own with many considering a skilled
    mage to be worth the equivalent of an entire squad of infantry.
  requirements:
  - None.
  guide: Mages offer supportive control to the party, out of combat utility and a
    barrage of long range spells to wither down the most evasive of targets. Sense
    Magic and Decipher Magic both serve as out of combat investigation tools. Sense
    Magic gives information, while Decipher Magic actively lets you disable magical
    fields. Arcane Barrier is a defensive tool that lets mages effectively block without
    having a high guard. If an attack did a low amount of damage, you may be able
    to use the Block reaction afterwards with the barrier still up and still get some
    value out of it. Glittershards is their control ability. It covers a 15x15ft area
    which is a decent area and be can be used primarily to block enemy ranged attackers
    from shooting you. The mana cost on it is low, so you can feel free to drop it
    and recast it in a better position if the need arises. Magic Missile is light
    attack that should be used against dodge heavy characters. If you know the enemy
    is not going to die from 1 missile, you can overcharge it and fire a second one
    for the same cost again. The target has to react to both of them with separate
    reactions, so you'll be doing some good damage or burning reactions with it.
