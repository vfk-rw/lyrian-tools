  requirements:
  - At least 1 class mastered.
  guide: As a Bloodbinder, you’ll want to hover around 50% HP to get the most out
    of Crimson Enmity. It’s a bit of a balancing act, but the extra healing boost
    is worth it. Your bread-and-butter combo is Transfusion followed by Blood Drain.
    Start by healing your allies with Transfusion, then use Blood Drain to top up
    your own HP. It’s a great way to keep both you and your team in the fight without
    leaving yourself too vulnerable. Blood Shield is super effective when you cast
    it on someone with high guard. It’s a two for one—blocking damage while also healing
    them up, so it’s a great move when you need to protect and patch up a teammate
    at the same time. Life Sacrifice takes you down to just 1 HP, but all that lost
    health goes directly into healing an ally, which can be a real game-changer when
    things get rough. If you pair it with Crimson Enmity, you can really boost its
    impact and turn the tide when your team needs it most.
