  description: Martial Artists are fighters whoâ€™ve turned their bodies into finely
    tuned weapons. All across the world of Lyr, you can find them practicing different
    arts and styles. The true might of the Martial Artist is their mastery of Zaipher,
    the skill of tapping into their internal mana to heal themselves and deal devastating
    magic-enhanced blows. Zaipher doesn't have the raw power of Arcane magic, but
    what it lacks in volume, it makes up for in blazing speed. Martial Artists utilize
    quick, sudden bursts of energy that can take an enemy by surprise.
  requirements:
  - None.
  guide: Martial Artists are strikers with a simple standard combo. Leg Sweep is the
    combo starter. Being knocked prone is already bad normally, but especially so
    against a martial artist. You should expect most enemies to attempt to react to
    a leg sweep. If they don't, or if you hit anyway, you can follow up with a Rushing
    Knee Drop. Rushing Knee Drop is guaranteed to hit and can be used with both AP
    and RP. The RP version is less efficient, but it can allow for a higher damage
    turn. Rushing Knee Drop can also be used when its not your turn, if an ally is
    able to render an opponent Prone. Because this is not on your turn, this version
    always costs an RP and can't be used with just an AP. The final part of the combo
    is Double Punch. This ability is good even by itself, paying 1 mana for an extra
    light attack. The mana cost does mean you can't simply use it every turn, but
    it's low enough that you should consider it on most turns. Their single non-damaging
    combat ability is Vital Drive. Vital Drive isn't very mana efficient, but it takes
    no action and you can potentially spend a lot of mana on it to heal for a large
    amount. Unarmed abilities only require a single free hand, so keeping an utility
    item in your offhand for quick use is possible.
