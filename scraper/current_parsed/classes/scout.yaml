  description: In the frostbitten silence at the edge of the Astra Lands, survival
    doesn’t just come from strength, it comes from knowing where not to step. The
    first to cross the threshold past Mirane were not conquerors or scholars, but
    a scattered few with sharpened senses and silent tread. It was the scouts, led
    by Elyne Ravas, that laid the first trail into the Astra Lands. Long, long before
    the existence of the Dragon Claw Alliance or the Mirane Expeditioner's Alliance,
    they were the ones that cleared the path, placed the first markers and discovered
    how vast the lands truly were. The things learned during that time were passed
    on and are still shared to this day. The scout’s role is not simply to guide,
    but to witness. To thread through impossible terrain, observe the unspeakable,
    and return with clarity while others return with nothing at all. Whether alone
    or among allies, they mark the path. Not for glory, but so others may live long
    enough to see it. "Eyes sharp, steps light. Leave no echo but the truth." -Ravas
  requirements:
  - Ranger mastered
  guide: The scout is a class that allows for more solo play than would normally be
    possible. With the high bonuses given from Independant Actor and the scout's retreat
    ability, a scout operating alone is unlikely to be caught out and trapped before
    they can escape. When you are forced to work in a team, you can take point with
    their Pathfinder ability and allow allies to move up unimpeded. With squadsight,
    you can spot out hidden enemies for your allies as well as increase the range
    of their ranged attacks. This can be very useful to allow allies that only have
    a light ranged weapon to fire at enemies further away. To move up in a fight without
    getting focused, you have Hide in bush. It won't work in every environment, but
    it allows you to remain hidden even if the terrain would normally be too open
    or there would be too many sight lines from different angles. Finally, your secret
    art is a powerful opening move that does require you to start the battle in stealth.
    It also requires you to use it as your first attack, but it's an auto hit attack
    that deals maximum damage and allows you to remain stealthed as a bonus.
