  description: Offensive powerhouses that overwhelm enemies with sheer force.
  requirements:
  - Berserker mastered.
  guide: Great Berserker are high risk, offensive powerhouses. Single-Minded Fury
    makes them focus on that 1 person, gaining a ton of bonuses and immunities, but
    being effectively useless against other enemies until that target is dead. Using
    it early or against the wrong target can make you ineffective in the fight. For
    example, a flying enemy may be unreachable for several turns in which you'd be
    able to do little. Simply running away is not much of an option however. Unrelenting
    assault prevents them from escaping through any means other than teleporting.
    Smash through the pain gives great berserkers a bit of survivability, though at
    the cost of using that RP to do more damage. It's pretty efficient and it stacks
    with your normal guard bonus. Victory or Death is a double-edged sword. Doing
    maximum damage is obviously good, but if you fail to finish off the enemy or enemies,
    then you will take a ton of damage on the turn after. It is best used when needing
    to finish off a high priority target or near the end of a fight. Because of the
    difference in damage rolls sizes, it is best used solely with heavy attacks. There's
    little benefit to maximum damage light attacks in most cases.
