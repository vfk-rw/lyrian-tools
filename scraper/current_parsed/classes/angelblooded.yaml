  description: Angelblooded are humans with angelic heritage that can transform into
    semi-divine beings.
  requirements:
  - Must have the Angelblooded breakthrough.
  guide: The main appeal of the angelblooded is the True Divine Release. Not only
    does it give flight and extra movement speed, it is also a requirement to use
    the other two abilities of the class. Unfortunately, the upkeep and cost make
    it hard to use until you obtain God's Blessing, which reduces both to 0. Once
    this class is mastered, it becomes very powerful. On top of the benefits mentioned
    above, you get to make a free light attack every round. You also get to do a stronger
    block every round, making blocking an option even if your toughness is low and
    you're not wearing armor. Even after mastering it, it is still a once per arc
    ability. Make sure you don't use it too early.
