  description: “Thank you, Sister Yselwen. We thank Kari’s Light for guiding you to
    us in our hour of need.” Yselwen gave the Elder a smile and a bow, resisting the
    urge to correct him. She wasn’t a Sister of his faith. But she held her tongue
    and turned away from the gathered villagers and the settlement. Once over the
    hill and fully out of sight, her shoulders drooped and her smile dropped. Rubbing
    a few frustrated circles on her forehead in an attempt to dispel the headache
    of dealing with the religiously righteous and ignorant, she turned from the packed
    dirt path and out into the wild fields. She took deep breaths as the scents of
    nature washed away the cloying dregs of the human settlement that seemed determined
    to cling to her. “Yggdrasil nerth iy thoir,” she prayed, fingers brushing against
    the stalks of wild wheat as she passed. She needed all the strength Yggdrasil
    could grant her after dealing with the Karites. At least the farmers had taken
    her teachings and blessings to heart. Not parroted like so many in recent days,
    but an actual understanding of the connection they were calling upon. It wasn’t
    enough to bring Yggdrasil to prominence, even if she could spread that same message
    to a thousand farmers across Westria, but it did sustain Her. Normally, she didn’t
    stray far from the borders of Easter, content to spread the Blessings of Yggdrasil
    where it was more accepted. But with a famine tearing its way across Lyr, she
    felt it was a ripe opportunity to help some people and spread Yggdrasil’s teachings
    a little wider. With a huff, she spun back toward her next destination, having
    not noticed she’d stopped to stare toward that stupid village with its stupid
    elder. They wouldn’t starve come winter and that was more important than a silly
    man pushing his faith on her. And so it went, village after village, town after
    town. Meetings with priests, elders, mayors, and farmers. Dealing with the initial
    distrust of her skin, the color of oak leaves in the autumn, or the claims of
    heresy at her words. But they all wanted to live, wanted to eat. So she taught
    and blessed and spoke to those that would listen. “Bennachd na Yggdrasil ar talah
    se,” would be repeated in broken, Westrian accents with earnest intent. “Gabthasinn
    a toirt Yggdrasil don tiodlac seo,” some would say on her departure, clutching
    at crudely woven tree effigies. For decades, Priestess Yselwen wandered the lands
    of Axia, Westria, and Northi. Where she tred, the famine faded. Her blessings
    and the teachings of Yggdrasil took root in small villages and in farmers’ hearts.
    The Dryad of the Fall became a myth and a legend, invoked in the same blessings
    she once taught. Some say that she still wanders the fields near Easter to this
    day, blessing those in need.
  requirements:
  - Farmer mastered
  guide: The cultivator uses their scythe more in combat compared to the farmer, though
    they retain their controller nature. Separate wheat from chaff is a large AoE
    attack with a knockback attached to it. Great for when you're surrounded and want
    to force grunts to spend more AP on movement. If you land a kill with this ability,
    then it becomes even more potent and could potentially deny a grunt of being able
    to do anything for a turn. Terracing is a reverse hole creation. You raise up
    the ground around yourself to force enemies to make athletics checks to get up
    to you. At 10ft high, you may be unable to strike back against an enemy unless
    you bring a range weapon, but it can still help in separating enemy formations.
    Harvest Moon is a powerful effect that costs a bit of mana to activate. The healing
    effect on it isn't very mana efficient, effectively just a healing potion, but
    it is free action wise. The slowing effect is large control effect that remains
    active, but upkeep cost can add up over time. If none of your allies need the
    healing, it may be smart end it early with the free heavy attack and look to regain
    some of the mana spent on it. On the crafting side, Four Field System is an ability
    you want to use at the start of your crafting basically every time. With Four
    Field System, even actions like Steady Craft become better than just doing a basic
    craft and it becomes better the more other crafting abilities you have.
