  description: Acolytes are practitioners of the mysterious power known as Faith,
    which is believed to be the oldest form of magic. In a world where The Church
    of Kari reigns as the most dominant religion, most Acolytes, about 95%, are Human,
    and nearly all of them, around 99%, belong to the Church. Acolytes are people
    with a special calling, blessed with the power to perform miracles thanks to their
    deep faith. They're part of a bigger community that includes other Acolytes, priests,
    and sometimes even Paladins. Because of this, they can usually find a safe place
    to rest and get help in churches and temples wherever they go. With their healing
    and protective abilities, Acolytes are essential members of any party, making
    sure their friends stay safe and well during tough battles.
  requirements:
  - None.
  guide: 'Acolytes are the main healers of groups of new adventurers, being the only
    tier 1 class with the capability to heal others. Their primary tool for this is
    Cure Touch. The mana cost is high, but it is still more efficient (and cheaper)
    than drinking a potion. Keep in mind that it does provoke attacks of opportunity,
    so position yourself behind the ally you''re healing if they are in melee combat.
    Light''s Care is some efficient after combat healing. It heals for the same amount
    as Cure Touch for a fraction of the mana cost. It also has the benefit of allowing
    the target to prevent an injury to themselves if they went down in combat. What
    makes an acolyte truly valuable for a newbie group is Angel''s Embrace. It has
    no mana cost and reduces the damage an ally takes by a large amount. The range
    is short, so most acolyte''s prefer a melee weapon. Since you are using your RP
    to help others, be wary that you don''t put yourself in a position where the enemy
    can focus you as your RP dwindles. Miracle: Sanctuary creates a small but durable
    barrier that can be used both offensively and defensively. When used defensively,
    it can give your allies a moment of reprieve, letting them drink a potion before
    going for a round two. It can also be used to trap an enemy inside the barrier,
    isolating it from its allies while your own allies wail on it.'
