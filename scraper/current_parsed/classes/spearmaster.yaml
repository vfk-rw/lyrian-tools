  description: An expert spear fighter.
  requirements:
  - Lancer mastered.
  guide: The spearmaster combines the damage dealing capabilities of the lancer and
    improves on them, adding some controlling power to the mix. Versatile range allows
    you to manipulate your own threatened range. This is useful in spread out melee
    fights where enemies may have too much freedom to move away from you otherwise.
    Draw-In can either be used as a tool to help position enemies for your allies
    or it can be combined with Lunge to draw an enemy far away into the range of your
    polearm. Spear Charge is effectively an upgraded version of the basic Charge that
    the fighter class has. It gives you a small damage bonus, but you are limited
    to a single attack even if you spend 4 AP. You can also combine it with Wild Thrusts.
    Wild Thrusts is an AoE attack that leads into a zone denial. The box it strikes
    in is fairly small, so it is most powerful in tight spaces. It disables your other
    attacks of opportunity, but you may cancel it when an enemy is about to provoke
    to attack them. The secret art Gae Bolg is a fairly simple move. With a relatively
    low cost for a secret art, it's a guaranteed hit with a heavy attack unless fate
    decides otherwise. It doesn't add any extra damage, so against Block type defenders
    it may not be worth the mana cost.
