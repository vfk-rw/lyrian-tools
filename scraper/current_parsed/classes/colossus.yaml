  description: A warrior that fights with two heavy weapons to crush their enemies.
  requirements:
  - Any tier 2 class mastered. Fighter mastered.
  guide: 'A colossus wants to use heavy weapons and Titan''s Grip means that there
    is very little reason not to do so. They can use Mighty Leap get into range of
    an enemy and disrupt all enemies around the target, allowing the Colossus to engage
    into groups of enemies without severe risk. You can also jump to an empty spot
    if your goal is just to land an AoE unbalanced debuff. Double Slam is two hit
    combo of which every hit can inflict a debuff on the enemy. You can combo it after
    apply Unbalanced with mighty leap for a double chance to knock someone prone.
    Two Sword Crush is a powerful ability that lets you push past the guard of an
    enemy. Slam and Double Slam both only apply their effects on damage and are light
    attack, making an enemy likely to Block against it. If their guard isn''t super
    high, you can then use Two Sword Crush to do more damage than their Block and
    apply the effect. Climax Art: Titan''s Blade is a powerful AoE attack that will
    annihilate people that cannot avoid the initial strike. Can be used as a finisher,
    but also an opening move to immediately burn some RP from enemies if they line
    up for you.'
