  description: Paladins are powerful warriors who receive their powers from their
    god. Shield paladins are frontline defenders and healers who can keep their weaker
    allies safe.
  requirements:
  - Human, proficient with shields
  - medium armor.
  guide: The shield paladin is a tank that focuses on blocking and temporary HP. Through
    their Aura of Protection, they allow their allies to block against attacks even
    if their Block is normally too low to be usable. This does cost mana and it requires
    your ally to block, so communication with your allies is key. With Holy Shield,
    you can convert AP into defense, gaining both a high Block potentially allowing
    you to block even heavy attacks and a decent check of temporary HP. You do give
    up damage by using too much AP on this, so it is not always the best option to
    dump all your AP into it. Divine Smite is a more offensive way to gain temporary
    hit points. It does require landing the heavy attack, but it can be used both
    on yourself or an ally. Shield paladins can also heal themselves or ally through
    their Lay on Hands ability. It's efficient both mana and AP wise, with the only
    drawback being that it only has a touch range. It does not provoke attacks of
    opportunity however, so you don't need to worry about disengaging from the fight
    before healing.
