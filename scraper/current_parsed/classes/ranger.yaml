  description: Rangers hail from the ranks of expert hunters and skilled military
    marksmen. Their senses and instincts are keen—taking down targets from incredible
    distances. Whether wielding bows, crossbows, or rifles, Rangers are always ready
    with an oppressive rain of missiles. An expert ranger has the ability to pick
    out targets of opportunity. They quickly zero in on the most vulnerable enemies,
    picking them off with precision. It’s this talent for oppressively breaking down
    the opposition that makes Rangers so effective in battle. Rangers have trained
    the ability to flood mana into their optical magic circuits—granting them the
    ability to see further and more sharply. They spot threats from great distances
    and then strike them with pinpoint accuracy. They're a welcome addition to any
    adventuring party. With sharp focus and deadly accuracy that makes them fearsome
    opponents.
  requirements:
  - None.
  guide: Rangers are versatile strikers that can excel at ranged combat, but can also
    fight in melee if required. Track is a pure out of combat utility tool that ensures
    the ranger can always follow tracks without rolling. Status Assessment is a support
    tool that lets your party know how injured a target is. Knowing the rough HP %
    of an enemy is important in making correct tactical decisions, whether it's who
    to focus fire or whether to retreat all together. Crippling attack can be used
    with both a melee and ranged weapon, but applying it from range is a lot more
    useful. Landing a slow on a melee enemy can allow you to kite it or seriously
    delay it from being able to attack. Snap Shot is an 1 AP heavy attack, but the
    chance to hit on it isn't going to be great. Rangers focused on power over focus
    may see some good use out of this ability. Even normal rangers should consider
    using this over a light attack when forced to choose between the two, especially
    against enemies with high guard against who a light attack would do very little
    even if it hits. Guided Aim is what rangers can spend a lot of mana on. It will
    remain a powerful ability especially as you go into later classes. Adding a bonus
    to your accuracy roll, even if the mana cost is higher for the benefit, can help
    make important abilities more reliable. With guided aim, you need to worry less
    about future secret art attacks barely missing.
