  requirements:
  - Rogue mastered
  - must possess Decipher Magic ability.
  guide: The thief is a class that steals things, whether it's small objects, magic
    or a grand robbery. Their infiltrate ability lets them sneak into magically guarded
    places without raising any suspicion. With Quick Getaway, you are able to escape
    from pursuers when you use it after Feint or Disengage. If used after feint, you
    can effectively more for 5 AP in 1 turn which lets you move faster than the enemy.
    Even against groups, they will never be able to catch up and attack in the same
    turn without movement abilities of their own. Fast Hands can also help with escaping,
    allowing you to open or close doors without using AP on them. It can also just
    let you draw a weapon or consumable. Snatch is a situational ability that makes
    it impossible for enemies to use consumables against you when you are close to
    them. If you are able to close in on an enemy before they can draw their weapon,
    you can even steal that. Spellsteal is another situational ability that lets you
    steal a buff from the enemy. It removes the buff from the enemy, so even if you
    can't use it very well it may still be worth using.
