  description: 'First fielded by Westria during the growing advent of the Church of
    Light and cavalry’s importance on the battlefield, the Mage Knight brought both
    magical support and healing to the highly mobile battlefront. While originally
    simply an order of priest-knights, Mage Knights would eventually grow to encompass
    all forms of magical casting. Whether it was raining down spells or utilizing
    their unique training to heal mount and rider both, the Mage Knight could turn
    the tide of a battle with their mere presence. And while there were countless
    stories throughout the ages of holy knights bringing men back from the brink of
    death, there were none as debated as the story of Dame Madeline Benoit and Sir
    Owain Morgan. As told and accepted by Westrian historians, Dame Madeline Benoit
    was a human Mage Knight without equal. Gentle and nurturing to her allies and
    able to bring her enemies low with figurative hellfire, she held a near saintly
    presence in the Church of Light. Debates would still sometimes crop up among the
    clergy as to her suitability as a Saint but her history was both ill documented
    and controversial, depending on who was asked. There was no dispute of her actual
    existence as her name was recorded as a Holy Knight of Kari, but there was a much
    debated feat in her history: Sir Owain Morgan and the proliferation of Great Knights
    into Westria’s military. While there were many versions of the tale, the most
    accepted one in Westria followed a series of reasonably set in stone facts. During
    the many border incursions from Northi as it tried to wrest control of the Nuren
    Plains from their ancestral owners, it was said that Dame Madeline Benoit helped
    devastate a Northi skirmishing force. Not only was she instrumental in capturing
    many of the Northi knights, she graciously tended to their wounds with a special
    focus on Sir Owain Morgan. The dogfolk Great Knight had taken the brunt of the
    Westrian counterattack as he shielded his men and required significantly more
    care than the others. In fact, he traveled back to Westria for further treatment
    while his men were released back to Northi. It was said that, in his gratitude,
    he volunteered the skills of the Great Knight and allowed Westrian artisans to
    study his and his mount’s armor. And while there was debate on the validity of
    that tale for the origin of the proliferation of Great Knights into the Westrian
    military, they paled in comparison to the vicious arguments that revolved around
    the love story between Dame Madeline and Sir Owain. The most commonly accepted
    telling of the great love between Madeline and Owain was that of star crossed
    lovers fighting destiny and the world to be together. What started as simple care
    for a wounded knight became tender affection as the months of Owain’s recovery
    ran on. Some accounts painted a picture of desperate, forbidden love with various
    forces working to keep them apart. Secret marriages, hidden lineages, and fantastical
    courtly intrigue plagued the romance novel market with few authors making any
    attempts to disguise their protagonists. The reality of it was much simpler and
    all the sweeter for it. Neither Madeline or Owain had the heart to return to the
    constant fighting between their two countries and retired from their respective
    militaries. The legend among the Benoit household was that the pair had a private
    wedding in the garden of Madeline’s childhood home and then departed for destinations
    unknown. The rumor was that they spent time as traveling knights, wandering Lyr
    and helping those in need. And while those actions had never definitively been
    attributed to Dame Madeline and Sir Owain, what couldn’t be denied was when they
    both turned back up in solid historical record. They would found Morgan Ranch
    in what would later become Dacquoise, near the future site of the city of Madeline.
    It was there that the retired knights, happily married for an unclear amount of
    time, had begun taking on students and ranch hands to teach the art of horsemanship,
    knighthood, and magic. While the ranch itself did not last into modern times,
    the house itself was maintained and the legacy of chivalry was upheld by the descendants
    of those students. Collectively, and informally, they called themselves the Knights
    of Morgan and dedicated themselves to helping those in need whenever and wherever
    they were found.'
  requirements:
  - Cavalier mastered.
  guide: 'The mage knight is a mounted healer that specializes in aiding other mounted
    combatants. Cavalry heal is a heal that heals both the rider and mount for a mana
    cost that is only slightly higher than a normal heal, making is pretty efficient.
    It is important to note that unlike a lot of other of the mounted class abilities,
    both spells of the mage knight can be used while dismounted. The other heal in
    question is Rescue, which is a mid range teleport spells that pulls an ally next
    to you. This immediately puts them in range for a healing ability. Unlike most
    teleport abilities, this pulls both mount and rider. Can also be used offensively
    to pull a slower ally closer to the enemy. Another way the mage knight can heal
    allies is by using Mounted Casting. You can ride past an ally and use Mounted
    Casting to heal them, then keep riding on to safety. If your way is blocked, you
    can also use Canter thanks to your key ability. Finally, your Secret Art: Ride
    of the Valkyrie requires some setup and positioning from your allies but it''s
    an efficient heal if you can hit your entire party with it. Can also be combined
    with trample, but be careful as your trample getting blocked may prevent further
    movement and healing.'
