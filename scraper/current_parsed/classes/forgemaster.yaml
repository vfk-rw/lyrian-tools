  description: Crafters who supply the world's weapons.
  requirements:
  - Blacksmith mastered.
  guide: 'The forgemaster retains their crafting focus and is able to craft higher
    quality items. With Inspired Finish you can add a large boost to your craft at
    the very end. However, you can''t do anything else after that so you might have
    to take a risk and apply the bonuses early, then hope you roll high enough. Forged
    Knowledge II now work on the weapons of allies as well, though you still need
    to have made their weapon. it also maximizes all the damage dice, which can create
    a sizeable damage increase on a bad damage roll. Secret Art: Shatter is either
    a Sure Hit heavy attack that deals good damage, or if they block it you destroy
    their weapon. Powerful against enemies that uses weapons, but it won''t have much
    use against non-humanoids.'
