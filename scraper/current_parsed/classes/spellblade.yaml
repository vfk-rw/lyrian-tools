  description: Spellblades are melee fighters that enchant their weapons with magic.
  requirements:
  - Have at least 1 spell
  - Have one element mastered
  - Be proficient in 1 weapon.
  guide: The spellblade is a melee class that relies on its versatility of its weapon
    enchantments to gain an edge in battle. Imbue Weapon allows you to always do damage
    that an enemy is weak to if you're aware of it. Greater Imbue Weapon is similar,
    paying 1 mana cost for +1 power bonus. Most of the time, if you are planning to
    stick with 1 enchantment, you will want to use the Greater version. In fights
    where you are constantly swapping your enchantment, it may be more worth to stick
    with the normal version. Draw Elements is what allows the spellblade to pick whatever
    element they want. Outside of elemental damage bonuses, this is mostly relevant
    for Elemental Strike. Elemental Strike is a light attack that can apply a whole
    variety of effects, based on what your weapon is currently enchanted with. Which
    one of these is the most effective depends heavily on the situation. Spellstrike
    lets you use attack magic despite being in melee combat. It is effectively the
    same as casting a spell without provoking attacks of opportunity, but since it
    is applied through your weapon it does benefit from Greater Imbue Weapon or similar
    weapon related buffs.
