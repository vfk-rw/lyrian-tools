  description: Guardians are heavily armored fighters that specialize in defense for
    both themselves and their allies.
  requirements:
  - Fighter mastered.
  guide: The guardian is a defender that wants to reduce damage through high toughness
    and heavy armor. They get access to this heavy armor, though the drawbacks of
    it are noticeable too. Too much guard may be overkill and it may be better to
    stick to medium or light armor in some cases. They control what the enemy can
    do by using Provoke and Threatening Aura. Provoke is a 1 turn Challenge for no
    AP cost, while threatening aura does cost 2 AP, but you automatically challenge
    everything around you. Challenge makes enemies provoke attacks of opportunity
    when they hit anybody except you, so you do need to keep in melee range of the
    enemies. Challenging Aura is especially good when you have other melee fighters
    that are squishy next to you. A berserker will greatly appreciate being hard to
    target. To help with being a threat with your attacks of opportunity, the controlled
    opportunities key ability gives you a small bonus to them. Thanks to it, guardians
    are more free to ignore focus and power and focus on defensive stats. Hold the
    line lets a guardian convert AP to RP at a good rate, at the cost of some mana.
    In a long fight, frequent use of this will let you keep your RP until you really
    need it. Last Stand is an ability that should only be used when you know you're
    going to face many attacks during the upcoming round. The RP cost is heavy, but
    it can easily be RP efficient. You don't need to use mana on this for it to be
    worth it, but it's worth considering if you are likely to face a bunch of heavy
    attacks.
