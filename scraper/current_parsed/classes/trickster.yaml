  description: Tricksters are a support class that cause chaos on the battlefield.
    The world is a stage.
  requirements:
  - Two classes mastered
  - of which 1 must be a tier 2 class.
  guide: The trickster is a support class that provides weird and unique benefits
    to the team. Assign Decoy gives the unique ability to taunt an enemy by an ally
    that would normally have no access to it. It can be used to temporarily make an
    enemy switch targets or if in a party without a tank, can be used to set up a
    sort of tank rotation. Swap gives the Trickster high control over the battlefield.
    They can walk near the edge of a clif, then swap an enemy next to it. Forcefully
    group enemies to setup for a teammates AoE attack. Swap an ally out of danger
    and much more. Extremely versatile and due to its Rapid nature and low cost can
    easily be spammed. Misdirected Blow has some conditions for it to be good, but
    it can turn enemies against each other. Most effective on tricksters with high
    agility, as it can let you evade blows that will hit most other targets. The Secret
    Art Grand Theater allows the trickster to set up a magnificent performance. They
    can force enemies to hit each other and give allies free actions. They just need
    to be careful, because even their allies are forced to attack and careless use
    may force them to attack an ally. Their perfect mimicry has little combat potential,
    but it allows a trickster to truly infiltrate a place and sow chaos.
