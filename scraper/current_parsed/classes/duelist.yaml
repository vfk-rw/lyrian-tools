  description: The Duelist is a highly skilled fighter who excels in one-on-one combat.
    They are agile and quick on their feet, using their speed and finesse to outmaneuver
    their opponents and deliver precise, deadly strikes.
  requirements:
  - Fencer mastered.
  guide: 'The duelist, like the fencer it builds on, is a 1v1 expert and off-tank
    on the battlefield. With deflect missiles, they gain some defense against ranged
    attacks. Riposte II is a more defensive version of the original riposte. Where
    the fencer traded the RP they saved from the Parry ability into damage, with Riposte
    II the duelist can dish out heavy attacks while sitting on all their RP still.
    It does cost mana, so it''s nothing something that should be used after every
    Parry. Duelist Blow is a powerful tool in 1v1s, but since the benefit disappears
    when forced to use RP against other targets it may be hard to use in fights against
    multiple enemies unless you can find isolated those 1v1s. Forward Momentum is
    a simple and cheap ability that helps with that. It''s best used with light attacks
    if the target still has RP remaining. A few attacks and the duelist can fight
    the target without interruptions. The Climax Art: Endless Waltz has the potential
    for a ton of attacks. It''s especially strong against enemies out of RP, against
    who it may repeat until they are dead. Against grunts, it can still be powerful
    although less consistent. The first attack would remove their RP, while the second
    would deal damage. Of course, bad rolls can happen and the ability may end early.'
