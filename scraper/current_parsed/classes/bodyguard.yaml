  description: Bodyguards specialize in protecting a single person.
  requirements:
  - Fighter mastered.
  guide: The bodyguard is focused around protecting a single target. You can choose
    who this target is with VIP Protection. They are well-suited to escort and protection
    missions, but even in normal ones they synergize well with squishy melee allies.
    Since they automatically get hit and can't react when using the redirect part
    of VIP Protection, having high Toughness and wearing armor is recommended. With
    Temporary Protection, the bodyguard can pay a heavy mana cost to protect another
    ally. It should only be used in emergencies, but using it on a low health ally
    can keep them in the fight without them having to play super defensive. Shelter
    is a more limited, but powerful version of the re-direct of the key ability. Heavy
    Attacks will do a lot of damage if you take them without reacting, so Shelter
    is best saved for those attacks. At your side helps you with positioning. It can
    save your VIP target when they do something stupid or if they get forcefully moved,
    but it can also be used offensively to teleport next to them when they charge
    ahead. Vengeance is a cheaper heavy attack that can be used if your VIP target
    was attacked. If the condition is met, there's rarely a reason not to use it.
    It becomes even more powerful if your VIP target is below 0 HP, though you obviously
    do not want that situation to happen to begin with.
