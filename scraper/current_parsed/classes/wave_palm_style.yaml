  description: The Wave Palm style does not strike with force, but disrupts the enemies
    internal lifeforce.
  requirements:
  - Martial Artist mastered.
  guide: The Wave Palm style focuses on disrupting enemy mana usage. Mana Sight lets
    you see the mana of all enemies. This will let you make better choices on who
    to attack. Two Point Strike is a light attack that applies the Wave Palm effect,
    which increases the enemies mana costs. It follows into Four Point Strike, which
    has greatly reduced costs and appiles a stronger debuff if combo'd. Against many
    normal monsters, the detonation effect for when your stacks exceed their maximum
    mana will happen quickly due to their low mana pools. This can potentially shut
    down powerful abilites they might have. The Mystic Eyes of Light Perception lets
    you see all HP and Mana, but more importantly it lets you see through cover and
    you automatically detect all hidden creatures. Very useful when you're under attack
    by rogues or other stealthy characters. Disrupt Ki is used against mages who are
    concentrating on spells to make them drop it.
