  requirements:
  - Mage mastered.
  guide: The warding mage is a utility class that relies on setting up defensive barriers.
    It is unsuited for many normal campaigns, due to the long casting time and only
    working when enemies come to you. In a campaign focused more around intrigue or
    where action takes place around a single place, they can provide peace of mind
    and creates a zone where enemies will struggle to fight in. Maintaining bounded
    fields reduces your maximum mana, but they last forever. Maintain the ones you
    need to and cancel fields once they have exhausted their use. Alarm Ward is the
    first field you get. It simply warns you (and others) when someone unwanted enters
    it. Many vaults, treasure rooms or other rooms containing important goodds or
    information will contain some form of an Alarm Ward. Explosive Ward is your second
    available field. It is usually placed on containers containing papers with sensitive
    information on it. If anybody tries to steal it, the papers will be destroyed
    even if the thief manages to get away. Sapping Ward is your final ward and one
    that greatly reduces the combat potential of any enemies entering it. The weakened
    condition is already bad enough, but grunts become stunned as well. Because a
    stunned target has no AP or RP, they will never be able to escape the ward while
    it lasts, essentially permanently disabling them for the encounter. Through hidden
    wards, you are able to hide your fields. With Disable Magic, you are able to disable
    other fields making Warding Mages good for infiltration as well.
