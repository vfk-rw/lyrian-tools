  description: Priests belong to a religion and utilize the mystery of divine power
    to protect and heal allies.
  requirements:
  - Acolyte mastered.
  guide: 'The priest has access to several healing and support abilities. Holy Light
    is a heal that doesn''t heal as much as Cure Touch does, but it costs less AP
    and most importantly, has greatly increased range. Where the acolyte has to play
    close to their allies and is at risk of provoking attacks of opportunity to heal,
    the priest doesn''t have that issue. Out of combat, Cure Touch is still better
    for healing. The Secret Art: Resurrect is an emergency heal that can only be used
    when an ally has already gone down. Note how it sets the targets HP to 0 before
    healing. This makes it have great synergy with demons or other abilities that
    allow a person to fight at full strength when below 0 HP. They can keep going
    until they reach heavy negative HP before they go down, after which you can bring
    them back up. Sacrament is a free buff that you will most likely want to apply
    to your strongest physical striker at the start of combat. Turning the weapon
    into holy damage can also be very helpful against certain enemies. Anathema is
    powerful debuff that lets your allies to greatly increased damage for 1 hit. It
    relies on a save instead of an attack roll, making it good against dodgy enemies,
    but less effective against enemies with high toughness. Because all the damage
    is added up, it can be good against high armor enemies if you manage to land it,
    but most high guard enemies will also have high toughness. It also has a noticeable
    mana cost, so be mindful of how much you use it.'
