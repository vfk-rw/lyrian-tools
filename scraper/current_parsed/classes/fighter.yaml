  description: Fighters come from many backgrounds. They can be adventurers, soldiers
    or even just travelers who've decided to master the arts of combat. They wield
    weapons with expert skill, making them the backbone of any adventuring party.
    What sets them apart from ordinary soldiers is their ability to perceive and control
    mana within their bodies. This keen understanding gives them an edgeâ€”allowing
    them to move at high speeds and deliver powerful blows. Fighters are a force to
    be reckoned with on the battlefield and welcome allies.
  requirements:
  - None.
  guide: Fighters are versatile front liners that are able to defend against attacks
    effectively while also exerting pressure on the enemy. A good fighter is expected
    to draw the enemy to them and to create space for the rest of their allies to
    unleash their full potential. Charge can be used to gain position in a fight without
    sacrificing attack. When moving in in the first round of a combat, you normally
    have to sacrifice attacks for the movement. Charge helps mitigate this, allowing
    the fighter to take point and still do damage. Slam is only a small knockback,
    but the AP cost of the attack is low and it has no other cost. It can be used
    to create space for an ally to safely escape, but a fighter can also use it at
    the end of their attack sequence. This way the target will need to spend 1 AP
    on movement again to get in range, lowering their attacks. Defensive Flexibility
    gives high RP economy, but it requires a bit of thinking ahead. It has to be used
    after you take one of the two basic reactions, and youll have to predict what
    your opponent will do next or force them to do suboptimal attacks. In long fights,
    consider what attacks you can safely tank without the use of RP to allow for more
    defensive flexibility uses in the future. Every RP you can spend that leads into
    defensive flexibility is effectively doubled. Power Strike is an attack that can
    deal a lot of damage, but is not very mana-efficient. It should almost always
    only be used against a target with no RP left. Fighters themselves don't have
    anything else that uses mana, so it's worth using for new characters. As you unlock
    more classes and get other abilities that use mana, Power Strike will probably
    not see much use anymore.
