Last Update: v1.0.1 in December 2024

This is a free sample set of my lovingly hand-painted hex and square terrain tiles. These assets will help you create an evocative landscape upon which to build an RPG campaign, a video game overworld, a strategy game map, or a boardgame-like experience.

If you've never used my tiles before, this might be of interest. If you have my tiles already, there's nothing new here. Every pixel of this asset set was hand drawn by myself, personally, so there is no risk to you of copyright infringement.

Assets included:
- Includes both square and hexagonal terrain tiles that fit into 256x256px grid cells, plus a few transparent-background decoration sprites.
- All assets are 24-big PNG files with transparent backgrounds (as applicable).
- All assets are provided at the size they were created.

These are sample assets that draw from my full, paid asset packs. I'll list them here:
