  description: 'Rangers hail from the ranks of expert hunters and skilled military
    marksmen. Their senses and instincts are keen—taking down targets from incredible
    distances. Whether wielding bows, crossbows, or rifles, Rangers are always ready
    with an oppressive rain of missiles.

    An expert ranger has the ability to pick out targets of opportunity. They quickly
    zero in on the most vulnerable enemies, picking them off with precision. It’s
    this talent for oppressively breaking down the opposition that makes Rangers so
    effective in battle.

    Rangers have trained the ability to flood mana into their optical magic circuits—granting
    them the ability to see further and more sharply.  They spot threats from great
    distances and then strike them with pinpoint accuracy.

    They''re a welcome addition to any adventuring party.  With sharp focus and deadly
    accuracy that makes them fearsome opponents.'
  guide: 'Rangers are versatile strikers that can excel at ranged combat, but can
    also fight in melee if required.

    Track is a pure out of combat utility tool that ensures the ranger can always
    follow tracks without rolling.

    Status Assessment is a support tool that lets your party know how injured a target
    is. Knowing the rough HP % of an enemy is important in making correct tactical
    decisions, whether it''s who to focus fire or whether to retreat all together.

    Crippling attack can be used with both a melee and ranged weapon, but applying
    it from range is a lot more useful. Landing a slow on a melee enemy can allow
    you to kite it or seriously delay it from being able to attack.

    Snap Shot is an 1 AP heavy attack, but the chance to hit on it isn''t going to
    be great. Rangers focused on power over focus may see some good use out of this
    ability. Even normal rangers should consider using this over a light attack when
    forced to choose between the two, especially against enemies with high guard against
    who a light attack would do very little even if it hits.

    Guided Aim is what rangers can spend a lot of mana on. It will remain a powerful
    ability especially as you go into later classes. Adding a bonus to your accuracy
    roll, even if the mana cost is higher for the benefit, can help make important
    abilities more reliable. With guided aim, you need to worry less about future
    secret art attacks barely missing.'
