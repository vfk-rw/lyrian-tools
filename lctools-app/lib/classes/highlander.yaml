  guide: 'The highlander is a reliable combatant that uses heavy melee weapons. Their
    aftershocks ability ensures that even if they miss their heavy attacks, they still
    deal some damage to the target and enemies around them.

    Steady Stance is cheap to activate and protects against most knockbacks and prone
    knocking abilities, assuming you''ve leveled Power a good amount. It can be used
    as a reaction, so you don''t need to activate it until you are hit by one of those
    types of abilities.

    Cleave is an AP efficient attack, provided you hit the first attack on the enemy.
    Best used if the first target has no AP remaining, but even on a miss you can
    do good damage with aftershocks.

    Knockdown Swing a simple ability that knocks people prone. It can be used to open
    up enemies for your allies or to make the enemy more vulnerable to your Overpower.

    Overpower can demolish enemies with much lower power than you, but it may not
    do much if their power is similar to yours. Evaluate how much power your opponent
    has before using it. Against prone enemies, the benefit is doubled making it almost
    always worth using.'
