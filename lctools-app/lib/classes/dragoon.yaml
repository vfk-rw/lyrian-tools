  description: Dragoons are a high mobility class that can fight at great heights
    without risk.
  guide: 'Dragoons excel at fighting at heights. They do not need to worry about fall
    damage when using their dragoon abilities and can turn it into damage for them
    by using Skydive. When not fighting on an airship or something else that flies,
    Dragoons can use buildings or trees to gain the height advantage.

    If there is nothing else around, Jump can be used. It is a decent initiation option,
    though Jump is often better used to reposition or escape from a bad situation
    than pure initiation.

    Dragonfire Dive is a powerful AoE tool that puts you in range to follow up with
    more attacks right after.

    Jump Back is an ability that allows the dragoon to perform hit and run attacks.
    You can engage, then jump back to force enemies to waste their movement in coming
    to you. When fighting in the air, you can jump on an enemy, kill it, then jump
    back to your airship. There''s a lot of possibilities, just keep in mind that
    it has to be used directly after a Jump ability. Don''t stick around for too long,
    or you aren''t able to get back.

    Their Secret Art: Dragonslaying Jump is what makes them masters of aerial combat.
    It is effectively a guaranteed heavy hit on a flying target that forces them to
    the ground. Against a target that is flying high above the ground, this last part
    can easily be fatal.'
