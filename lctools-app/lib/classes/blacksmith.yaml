  guide: 'Blacksmith is a crafting class that creates weapons. A lot of your abilities
    and use will come during interlude phases where you can craft your weapons.

    Outside of crafting, you can use Forged Knowledge to boost the damage of an attack
    you made. It requires you to use a weapon you crafted yourself and you only maximize
    one dice, so use it when you are a few points of damage of from killing an enemy
    or to turn a 1 into a 6 or 8.

    With Weapon Maintenance, you give a weapon a +1 bonus to damage or accuracy. It
    only costs an encounter start action, so there''s no reason not to do it if you
    aren''t using it for anything else.

    When crafting, Steady Craft II is better than rolling on average. You can delay
    using it to see if you need a higher number at the end before using it, but it
    will be better most of the time.'
