  description: The Wave Palm style does not strike with force, but disrupts the enemies
    internal lifeforce.
  guide: 'The Wave Palm style focuses on disrupting enemy mana usage.

    Mana Sight lets you see the mana of all enemies. This will let you make better
    choices on who to attack.

    Two Point Strike is a light attack that applies the Wave Palm effect, which increases
    the enemies mana costs. It follows into Four Point Strike, which has greatly reduced
    costs and appiles a stronger debuff if combo''d. Against many normal monsters,
    the detonation effect for when your stacks exceed their maximum mana will happen
    quickly due to their low mana pools. This can potentially shut down powerful abilites
    they might have.

    The Mystic Eyes of Light Perception lets you see all HP and Mana, but more importantly
    it lets you see through cover and you automatically detect all hidden creatures.
    Very useful when you''re under attack by rogues or other stealthy characters.

    Disrupt Ki is used against mages who are concentrating on spells to make them
    drop it.'
