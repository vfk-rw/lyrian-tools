  description: A name given to warriors who suffer from a terrible curse. Their frequent
    misfortune is well known with even their weapons often managing to strike themselves
    instead of their enemies. However, there are some who manage to channel this misfortune
    and use its power against their enemies.
  guide: 'The Curse Knight is a class that can deal a high amount of damage at the
    cost of their own health.

    Backlash is guaranteed damage on an enemy that they almost cannot stop, but you
    also take some damage yourself. It''s good for finishing off low health targets
    or in fights where you feel the HP loss won''t matter.

    Devil''s Blow is another good damage dealing ability that comes with a risk of
    potentially hitting yourself. The mana cost is low, so the attack can be spammed
    as long as you feel lucky. If you have an oracle in your party, then this attack
    is almost always safe to use.

    Devi''s Curse relies on the enemy missing to deal damage to them. Best used on
    their heavy attacks, as the mana cost may not be worth it to reflect a light one.

    The Secret Art: Life Bet lets you do one massive hit, but the damage is based
    on how much HP you lose from it. Finding an optimal timing may be difficult, as
    you don''t want to use it while an enemy still has reactions left but as the fight
    drags on, your HP will most likely be lower. Having support from your allies or
    your other abilities will be key in using this secret art.

    Finally, the key ability On my terms allows you to continue using your abilities
    even as your HP gets lower. You won''t need to worry about accidentally killing
    yourself. You can also use it to effectively ignore enemy attacks of opportunity
    while you''re at low HP, since they will never kill you anyway or stand in effects
    that trigger at the start of your turn such as a fire.'
