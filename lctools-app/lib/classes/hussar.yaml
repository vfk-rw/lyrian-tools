  description: 'The romantic image of cavalry often brought to mind knights in gleaming
    plate armor, resplendent in heraldry, astride a powerful steed. Lances, spears,
    and longswords held aloft, ready to ride nobly into the fray. Ready to rescue
    princesses, slay dragons, and dispatch dishonorable knaves. While many knights
    struggle to live up to that image, the origin of those lofty traits could be found
    in the Hussars.

    Named after the light cavalry unit raised from the nobles and knights of Macaron
    in Dacquoise, the Macaron Hussars set a standard for both chivalry and battlefield
    prowess that has remained largely unchallenged even into the modern day. While
    the individual knights may have their betters in swordsmanship or as riders, the
    combined unit has been considered the premier elite light cavalry force since
    its creation across all of Lyr. Sworn directly to the King of Dacquoise, the honor
    within the ranks of the Macaron Hussars is such that there has never been a recorded
    or rumored instance of betrayal of their oaths, even during the rare instances
    of attempted usurpation of the Line of the King. They have never failed to follow
    the rightful King or Heir of Dacquoise.

    Their metal was tested in recent memory at the Battle of Nuren Crossing where
    the combined forces of the Nuren Guard and a small adventuring party held a critical
    bridge crossing against Northi invasion during the Four Swords War. The Northi
    commanders, intent to utilize Dacquoiseâ€™s roads to move rapidly into a flanking
    position against Mothergreen, attempted to take the northernmost bridge crossing
    of the Nuren river. When they were unable to capture the bridge with their scouts,
    the Northi force was pinned against the river by Lamian elements of the Nuren
    Guard. Before they were able to withdraw and regroup, the hammer of the Macaron
    Hussars smashed them against the Lamian anvil, having used a risky ford miles
    downstream. With their support elements gutted, supplies captured, and further
    Dacquoise reinforcements incoming, the invading force surrendered and were permitted
    to withdraw back to Northi.

    Hussars around the world have strived to live up to the gallantry and reputation
    of their namesakes, always chasing that seemingly distant goal. And while more
    renegade knights have taken up the skills of mobility and devastatingly powerful
    charges that the Hussars are known for, many still believe that the embodiment
    of the knight as demonstrated by the Macaron Hussars was a goal worth striving
    for.'
  guide: 'The hussar is a mounted class that overwhelms the enemy with devastating
    charges.

    Cavalry charge is a movement ability that boosts your trample. It has no additional
    cost over normal movement, so you should always use this if you''re planning to
    trample enemies over moving normally. Any non-heroic enemy with your trample also
    becomes Shaken, which basically makes them useless on their next turn.

    Momentum is an ability that you can use after you''ve moved in range of the enemy
    with your charging attack, as it can gain a large damage boost. Another option
    is to strike at a non-heroic enemy that used their RP to dodge your trample. They''ll
    now have no RP left and your momentum boosted attack is likely to one shot them,
    especially if using a lance.

    Break Away is the ability you use to move away from the enemy to prepare for another
    trampling charge attack. The mana cost is relatively high, so ideally you don''t
    want to be in a position where you have to use it.

    Secret Art: Override is a powerful secret art that relies heavily on enemies being
    in a line to get maximum value out of. Be careful when using this against rogues,
    their evasive maneuvers ability can force you to end your override early by creating
    an empty space.'
