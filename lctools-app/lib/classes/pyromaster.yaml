  guide: 'The Pyromaster is AoE striker that deals fire damage. Their Eternal Flames
    ability heavily punishes people who don''t immediately remove the burns they inflict,
    all but ensuring they will die eventually. They rely on the pyromancer''s ignite
    for many of their burning needs.

    Fireball II is their one ability that inflicts Burning without the need of ignite.
    This makes it more mana and action efficient than a normal fireball. If needed,
    the size of it can also be increased by spending more mana. Good for those situations
    where a few enemies are barely out of range.

    Blast Wave is a self peel tool. It also knocks back allies, so be mindful of your
    positioning.

    Fireball Barrage lets you pelt an entire battlefield with fireballs. Very likely
    to be useful at the start of a fight where enemies are not yet clustered into
    one position.

    The Climax Art: Meteor is a sure hit attack that can only be avoided by walking
    out of the area before it lands. The damage potential of this ability when overcharged
    to the maximum is insane, though you are unlikely to be able to do so. Even when
    used at just 4 AP, the damage is high. You will need to rely on your teammates
    or terrain to keep enemies inside the strike radius however.'
