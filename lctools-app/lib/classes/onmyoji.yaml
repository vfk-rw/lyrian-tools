  guide: 'The Onmyoji is a utility class that focuses on using talismans, scrolls
    or similar items. They can either create their own or use those created by others.
    Buying talismans from others is an excellent way to increase your versatility
    in combat or plug the gaps in your party composition.

    Create Talisman lets you make your own talismans. The main benefit of this is
    that it lets you prepare expensive spells in advance, allowing you to pay the
    mana cost at a point where you don''t care about it instead of in the middle of
    combat. You can also possibly prepare certain buff spells for your allies, though
    they will have to pay the mana cost again themselves if they aren''t also an Onmyoji.

    Secret Talisman is an ability that just lets you use a Secret Art that''s on a
    talisman. Secret Arts are normally limited to once per encounter, so being able
    to use two can be quite the power boost.

    Sealing Talisman is a powerful CC, but it comes at the cost of having to prepare
    the talisman beforehand. Grunts have little counterplay against it, but even against
    heroics you can force them to waste quite a bit of AP for no AP cost of your own.

    Preparedness gives you a bit more flexibility and options in what you can bring.
    Overall, Onmyoji is very reliant on either outside sources of talismans or in
    having strong classes to complement it to really shine. It is not recommended
    to take the class without taking some other classes beforehand or having a clear
    goal in mind.'

    description: You may create a talisman or scroll. Choose an ability that you know
      or choose a specialized talisman, such as a Sealing Talisman. You inscribe that
      Spell onto a piece of paper, paying any mana cost if applicable. If a Spell
      has X mana cost, the X must be paid at the time of use. A talisman of a Spell
      allows you to use the Spell at a different time. When you use it, it is consumed.
      A Spell talisman costs as much AP and mana to use as the original Spell does,
      though your key ability may reduce this mana cost to 0. You may only craft Secret
      or Climax Art talismans by using an interlude point. A crafted talisman costs
      1 burden to carry with you. A Secret or Alimax Art talisman costs 2 burden.
      At the end of the encounter, any talismans stored like non-combat items lose
      their power.

      If they do not remove it by the end of their turn, they become Stunned. While
      the talisman remains attached, the target is stunned. Anyone within touching
      distance of the talisman may spend 2 AP to remove the talisman, immediately
      removing the stun effect. If the talisman is not removed, it lasts until the
      end of encounter or until the target takes damage. A person can only be affected
      by 1 Sealing Talisman at a time.
