      description: Fighter mastered, Proficient in polearms.
  description: Lancers are a class that specializes in using polearms.
  guide: 'Lancers prefer to let the enemy come to them. The full pierce effect gained
    from their Brace key ability makes even a readied light attack do good damage.

    Extending Spear allows the lancer to attack from long range and hit a lot of enemies
    if they line up. Extending Spear followed by a readied attack is a good way to
    start fights and wait for the enemy to get closer.

    Once they are close, a crescent sweep can knock them all off their feet and set
    them up for the rest of the team.

    When there is only a few enemies, look for a position to use Piercing Stab in.
    2 AP for 2 heavy attacks is very cost efficient, even if you have to move for
    1 AP to position for it.

    Finally, lunge with a polearm gives you a 20ft attack range. This is long enough
    to hit basically every enemy in the front line and may be enough range to even
    hit a backline target that moved up too far.'
