  description: Snipers are expert marksmen that use sniper rifles to devastating effect.
  guide: 'The sniper uses sniper rifles to fire at enemies from far beyond a range
    in which they can counter. It will be rare to get these extreme range fight, but
    you should always look to play as far back as possible.

    Ideally, you want to move as little as possible to get the accuracy bonus from
    Snipe. Positioning well early in the fight will keep paying off as it goes on.

    Penetrating Shot allows you to remain stationary without having to care about
    the cover the enemy has. Check with the GM if their cover can be penetrated before
    using it.

    With Concealed Shot, you are able to keep entering stealth after firing make your
    attacks impossible to react to. The RP cost may not be an issue either as long
    as you can stay far enough away from the fighting that you do not take counterattacks.

    Aimed Shot is a lock-on Heavy attack that can punish dodge users. Stealthed attacks
    can do the same, but you won''t alway have that option.

    Killshot is the opening move of the sniper, provided you are able to remain hidden
    from the enemies before the fight starts. Normally high AP abilities do not gain
    the benefit of being a hidden attacker, but Killshot is an exception to this if
    used in the first round. This lets a sniper do huge damage right from the start.
    You can combine it with the ranger''s guided aim ability for an almost certain
    hit that cannot be reacted to in any way.'
