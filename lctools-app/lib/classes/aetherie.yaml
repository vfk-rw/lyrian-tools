  description: 'The Four Swords War pushed the boundaries of artifice and magic in
    the way only a continent spanning conflict can. Entire schools of magic were created
    and artifice technology raced forward at breakneck speed. The Aetherie were but
    one of those desperate developments. Founded from the study of the genius work
    of a Lu Clan demon by Axian and Sorthen researchers, the brief life of the namesake
    of the magical discipline is inescapably entwined with the art of Mind Connection.

    Aetherie Lu’Pana earned her right as a master of magic in the middle of her own
    apprenticeship as the war with Westria and Northi pushed into Sorthen’s borders.
    After reading through the requests passed to her master for a method to counter
    or break through Northi artifice communications jamming, Aetherie offered up her
    own research project: a mind/mana connection technique. It didn’t take long after
    successfully demonstrating the new magic that her preliminary plans for an amplifying
    artifice was put into the prototype stage. She and the prototype were rushed toward
    the rapidly collapsing front where she was able to establish communications between
    General Ar’Golan and his battalion commanders, using herself as a conduit. This
    ability to coordinate in real time using the eyes of his own commanders allowed
    the Sorthen Rear Guard to briefly hold the invading armies at the Battle of Three
    Passes for the critical weeks needed for their remaining forces and critical civilians
    to be evacuated to Marlone.

    Unfortunately, the defense collapsed when Aetherie Lu’Pana, pushed beyond her
    limits by the strain of upkeeping her Mind Connection using the prototype sensory
    station, died from the strain. Her notes and the testimony of the one surviving
    commander from Three Passes that had been Mind Connected was studied carefully
    and the “Aetherie Mind Connect” school of magic was codified shortly after the
    war.

    Aetherie are a rare breed of mage. The mental fortitude required to process multiple
    viewpoints and even spread their influence out from those they’re connected with
    does not come easily and there are whispered stories of would-be Aetherie losing
    their minds in the ebb and flow of magic. But a well practiced Aetherie, with
    proper support and equipment, can bring unprecedented support and coordination
    to any group.'
  guide: 'The Aetherie is a long range utility and support class.

    While it can function at close range, the main draw is to use Mind Connection
    to set up a telepathic link and work off your allies while you remain somewhere
    else. This range is further boosted if you can afford the sensory mage suit, so
    you should invest in that if you plan to play this way.

    Psychometry is a free or almost free scouting ability that is very valuable in
    dungeons or other indoor explorations. It can let your party properly prepare
    before entering dangerous room.

    Conduit is what lets you use abilities from other classes while playing from long
    range. There are still some restrictions on what you can do, so picking classes
    that synergize well with this ability is important.

    Tap Cracker lets you open doors from a distance, which can be useful in avoiding
    traps. You can also unlock doors, allowing you to fulfill a niche without having
    to invest many skill points into it.

    Spirit Circuit Crash is a powerful ability that removes a targets ability to use
    mana without any roll or save. Because it doesn''t have a mana cost, you can effectively
    keep a target from using a mana ability the entire fight unless they choose to
    take the damage. But be aware that not every enemy will have or use mana.'

    description: By touching the door to a room you gain information as to the physical
      layout of the room and objects within it as if you were able to see inside of
      the room.  By reading the Auras of all creatures within the room, you can also
      get a general idea of any creatures within, which you see as blobs of light—brighter
      for more powerful auras.  You can also use this effect on containers as well
      to get a general idea of the layout within containers like backpacks, and chests. 
      This ability can be used at unlimited range as long as a creature under the
      effect of Mind Connection touches the door or container.

      damage or heal.  Effects that could possibly deal damage or heal cannot be used
      through Conduit unless specified.  You also cannot use conduit with abilities
      that require a physical object to be present, such as a Mystic Eye power or
      a specific weapon. You still must pay the costs to use the abilities, and your
      Mind Connection source becomes the origin point of the spell for purposes of
      range.
