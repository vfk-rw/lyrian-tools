  guide: 'The spearmaster combines the damage dealing capabilities of the lancer and
    improves on them, adding some controlling power to the mix.

    Versatile range allows you to manipulate your own threatened range. This is useful
    in spread out melee fights where enemies may have too much freedom to move away
    from you otherwise.

    Draw-In can either be used as a tool to help position enemies for your allies
    or it can be combined with Lunge to draw an enemy far away into the range of your
    polearm.

    Spear Charge is effectively an upgraded version of the basic Charge that the fighter
    class has. It gives you a small damage bonus, but you are limited to a single
    attack even if you spend 4 AP. You can also combine it with Wild Thrusts. Wild
    Thrusts is an AoE attack that leads into a zone denial. The box it strikes in
    is fairly small, so it is most powerful in tight spaces. It disables your other
    attacks of opportunity, but you may cancel it when an enemy is about to provoke
    to attack them.

    The secret art Gae Bolg is a fairly simple move. With a relatively low cost for
    a secret art, it''s a guaranteed hit with a heavy attack unless fate decides otherwise.
    It doesn''t add any extra damage, so against Block type defenders it may not be
    worth the mana cost.'
