  guide: 'The thief is a class that steals things, whether it''s small objects, magic
    or a grand robbery.

    Their infiltrate ability lets them sneak into magically guarded places without
    raising any suspicion.

    With Quick Getaway, you are able to escape from pursuers when you use it after
    Feint or Disengage. If used after feint, you can effectively more for 5 AP in
    1 turn which lets you move faster than the enemy. Even against groups, they will
    never be able to catch up and attack in the same turn without movement abilities
    of their own.

    Fast Hands can also help with escaping, allowing you to open or close doors without
    using AP on them. It can also just let you draw a weapon or consumable.

    Snatch is a situational ability that makes it impossible for enemies to use consumables
    against you when you are close to them. If you are able to close in on an enemy
    before they can draw their weapon, you can even steal that.

    Spellsteal is another situational ability that lets you steal a buff from the
    enemy. It removes the buff from the enemy, so even if you can''t use it very well
    it may still be worth using.'
