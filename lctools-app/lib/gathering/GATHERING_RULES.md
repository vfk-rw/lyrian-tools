Gathering
Gathering is the collection of resources from a resource node, such as mining an iron outcrop or harvesting a herb.

To start gathering, a person must first find a suitable resource node. They then need a suitable tool for the gathering action, such as a pickaxe for mining.

Outcrops:
An outcrop is a resource node that a gatherer can gather from. Outcrops have the following values:

HP: All outcrops have an HP value. A gathering attempt reduces this by 1 after it finishes. When an outcrop is reduced to 0 HP, it can no longer be gathered from.
Node Points: The node's normal gathering points which must be cleared to claim any reward.
Lucky Points: The node's rare points which must be cleared in order to claim the node's rare reward. Note that node points must still be cleared to gain any reward.
Yield: How much units are obtained from clearing
Lucky Yield: The rare resource that is obtained from clearing Lucky Points

Variations:
Outcrops may have modifiers on them that increase or decrease the difficulty or rewards. The GM should roll a d20 to determine the modifier:

(1) Explosive Node:  If you do not complete the NP requirement, the rock explodes and you are inflicted by an injury.
(2) Hazard Node:  Every mining action deals 1d4 damage to you.
(3) Barren Node:  There is no Rare Yield for this node.
(4) Obscured Node:  -1 Dice
(5) Muddy Node: -1 Dice, all other gathering dice are upgraded to d20.
(6) Arcane Node:   Abilities that grant LP now give NP, abilities that grant NP now grant LP.
(7) Volatile Node:  Rolls 1-5 are now 1.  Rolls 6-10 are now 10.
(8-13) Normal Node: No changes
(14) Deep Node:  The last HP of the outcrop grants rare yield for both NP and LP values.  However all other HP has only normal materials for both NP and LP Values.
(15) Hardened Node:  Tool bonuses are doubled.
(16) Alloy Node:  This node has half normal yield, but grants two different rare yield materials.
(17) Hardened Node:  Tool bonuses are doubled.
(18) Exposed Node: +1 Dice
(19) Rich Node:  Yield and Rare Yield are doubled.
(20) Exposed Rich Node: +1 Dice and Yield and Rare Yield are doubled.

Example Node:
Normal Silver Outcrop
HP: 3
Node Points: 40
Lucky Points: 15
Yield: 500 units of iron
Lucky Yield: 500 units of silver.

Rough idea of what a node should look like.

Difficulty	Node Points	Lucky Points
Safe	35-40	5-10
Easy	30-35	20-25
Standard	35-40	15-20
Tough	45-50	10-15
Greedy	25-30	30-35
Gathering:
When you start gathering you receive 5 strike dice you can use in the gathering session. Each Strike Dice is a d10 that you may use to make gathering checks. A gathering check is as follows:

d10 + Gathering Skill + Expertise + Modifiers

A gathering check is normally made against the Node Points, though some abilities will let you make it against Lucky Points as well.

Abilities may cost Node or Lucky Points in addition to Strike Dice. You must be able to pay the cost for these abilities to use them and cannot go negative.

You may use gathering abilities until you can no longer use any. If you've cleared the Node Points when you are done with the gathering session, you receive the yield. If you also cleared the Lucky Points, you also receive the Lucky Yield.

You can only attempt to gather from an outcrop once per day. However, multiple gatherers may gather from the same node while its HP lasts.

Example:
John Mining comes across a silver outcrop with 40 NP and 15 LP. His mining bonus is a +5.

He opens with Power Rock Strike and rolls a 6. His gathering bonus is halved, so he adds an 8 to both NP and LP
He uses Iron Focus as his second action, and rolls a 1. He adds 6 to his NP and lowers his LP by 5 for a total of 16 NP and 1 LP
He does a basic strike and rolls a 9. He adds 9+5+5 (From IF) to his NP for a total of 35 NP and 1 LP.
He does an efficient strike and rolls a 5. His total is 15, 5 of which gets added to NP and 10 which overflows into LP for a total of 40 NP and 11 LP
For his final actions he does Novice's Perseverance and rolls a 3 and a 2. He picks the 3 (+5 from IF) into LP for a total of 40 NP and 19 LP.
This beats both the NP and LP requirements, so John obtains both the iron and silver rewards.
Basic Gathering Actions:
Basic Strike: Rapid. 1 Strike Dice. You add a gathering check to the node points to the target node.

Lucky Strike: Rapid. 1 Strike Dice, 10 Node Points. You add a gathering check to the lucky points to the target node. This strike has a +10 bonus.

Noviceâ€™s Perseverance: 1 Strike Dice. You do not add your crafting skill to the check, but you roll two d10s and pick the highest. Can be used against either NP or LP

Back To Basics: 2 Strike Dice. Convert all LP up to a maximum of 60 to NP.

Iron Focus: 1 Strike Dice, 5 Lucky Points: Make a gathering check. Afterwards, you gain a +5 bonus to all gathering checks for the rest of this gathering session.
