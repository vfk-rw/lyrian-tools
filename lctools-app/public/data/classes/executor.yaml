    Executors are good against mages. Holy Orders gives them sticking power to a
    single target that is almost impossible to escape from. Because they can
    only attack a single target, it does mean they cannot threaten multiple
    backline threats by themselves. Sometimes, it may be worth foregoing the
    holy orders until later.

    Deus Vult can only be used against people who have Holy Orders on them. It
    allos the executor to trade an RP for an offensive boost, making for an
    attack that is hard to dodge. It also gains the shieldbreaker property,
    which can heavily punish mages.

    It is best used in combination with Ave Maria. It has a higher AP cost, so
    missing it is particularly bad which deus vult helps prevent. It can be
    worth tossing out against a target that has no RP left, especially if they
    have higher guard. It also does Holy damage, which may be relevant against
    some enemies.

    Eagle Hunt is what Executors use to get in range of their targets. They can
    leap over the frontline and land in the back. It may also be used as an
    escape tool or it can be seen as a cheap movement option if you are already
    planning to use Silentium, which gets a 1 AP discount when used during Eagle
    Hunt. Silentium is primarily used against mages, against who disabling their
    concentration can be devastating. It also disables their spells until they
    remove it, which can be seen as effectively lowering their RP or AP for the
    next turn. Use with Deus Vult when you absolutely need to cancel an ongoing
    spell they are concentrating on.

        You infuse a light thrown weapon with Sacred Power and Light Attack the

        magic circuits, breaking concentration and preventing the target from
        using abilities with the Spell keyword. The lodged weapon can be removed
        for 1 RP or 2 AP, removing the disruption.
