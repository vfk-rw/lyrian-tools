    It was difficult to pin down the origins of anything throughout history.
    Plenty of ideas and methods were known to crop up simultaneously among
    completely isolated groups by simple happenstance. However, it was largely
    accepted that the idea of modern cavalry began with the arrival of nomadic
    human tribes from the north east of Lyr. Masters of their stocky, resilient
    horses, they migrated south west out of the tundra and steppe due to
    extremely harsh seasons and famine. Forced to avoid the forests of Easter to
    the south and pushed away from the budding kingdoms in Northi to the west,
    the nomadic humans settled in the lush plains of Axia and Nuren. Their art
    of mounted archery gave them unparalleled hunting abilities and made them
    maddeningly difficult to chase down, even from the fleet footed catfolk and
    rabbitfolk.

    For a time, the Nomads roamed plains, breeding ever stronger horses and
    leading a relatively simple life. They didn’t know that their presence
    forced the kingdoms of Northi to push their influence west into Susururu
    Forest, displacing wolf-folk and lamiafolk, and to the selkies of Houkaina
    on the coast. But eventually, with nowhere to continue expanding aside from
    the frigid north, Northi returned its attention to the plains. Utilizing
    enslaved centaurs as mounts, the catfolk hoped to narrow the mobility gap
    and to be able to finally hunt down the annoying humans. But without any
    static settlements and their mastery of the plains, the Nomads were still
    able to control the pace of any battles or hunts.

    Simultaneous to the more concentrated efforts from Northi, humans from
    Westria began to treat with the nomadic tribes of the Nuren Plains. They
    traded for horses, for trainers, and offered riches beyond the nomadic
    tribes’ wildest dreams for empty land. Northi wasn’t alone in dreaming of
    securing the plains for their potential wealth of farmland, but the humans
    from the south recognized that the Nomads had completely stalled chimeran
    expansion with their mastery of horses and Westria had long been praying for
    something that would let them protect themselves from the chimera and fae.
    Humans had a long history of domesticating animals to help balance the
    strengths of their neighbors: dogs for hunting, oxen for burden…the
    introduction of horses was simply another method to overcome their
    weaknesses.

    With a combination of various deals with the nomads and utilizing their own
    methods against them, Westria was finally able to push its borders to the
    edge of the forest and the Nuren River. Their actions unfortunately
    displaced or eradicated tribes of nomads that resisted the territorial grab.
    Some historians believe that ancient, bad blood was one of the larger
    factors for the rise of independent nations along Westria’s north eastern
    border. Many humans from the plains regions could still claim ancestors from
    those nomadic tribes and while there was no official animosity, some were
    convinced there was an overarching reason they had carved out their
    independence from both Northi and Westria.

    The nomad is a ranged cavalry class that can be nearly impossible to catch.

    As a nomad, you excel in fights where you have a lot of space to run around
    it. Your light cavalry key ability makes you able to fight at maximum
    potential even in terrain that would normally be unfavorable for you,
    allowing you to keep your full mobility.

    Hit & Run is an ability that can either be used with a melee or ranged
    weapon. With a melee weapon, it does provoke an attack but it lets you move
    away from the enemy while dealing damage. With a ranged weapon it allows an
    essentialy free reposition and enables you to keep your distance from the
    enemy. It also allows you to use Running Shot.

    Runing Shot is a 1 RP cost ability that lets you make a Heavy attack. It
    does require you to move before you can use it, but Nomad has several ways
    of doing that. The RP cost is normally a big risk for a character to spend
    on offensive abilities, but as a nomad you have enough mobility and range
    that you can afford to spend some of it on doing more damage.

    Trailblazer is an utility ability that helps your allies get across
    difficult terrain. It can also be used to help them get into the fray
    faster, though it does cost them some RP.

    Your Secret Art: Chase the Horizon is the ultimate kiting tool against a
    single enemy. It has a steep mana cost for the duration, but it ensures the
    target you pick cannot catch you while its active and you can punish them if
    they do move. It's best used when kiting a boss or when a melee enemy is far
    away from anything to attack. If they are forced to spend 4 AP on movement
    to do anything, then you get 4 attacks which is not bad for the cost.

        You focus on a single enemy and maintain a constant position from them.
        Whenever the target moves, you may move the same amount as they did (up
        to your movement speed) away from them for 0 RP. This movement does not
        provoke attacks of opportunity from the target, but does provoke from
        other enemies.

        Every time this happens, you may make a Light attack against the target
        with a ranged weapon. If the target spends multiple AP on a single
        movement action, you may make an amount of Light attacks equal to the AP
        they spent.

        Lasts until the start of your next turn or until you can no longer see
        the target.
