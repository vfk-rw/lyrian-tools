  description: Warding Mages focus on creating bounded fields that ward off intruders.
  guide: >-
    The warding mage is a utility class that relies on setting up defensive
    barriers. It is unsuited for many normal campaigns, due to the long casting
    time and only working when enemies come to you. In a campaign focused more
    around intrigue or where action takes place around a single place, they can
    provide peace of mind and creates a zone where enemies will struggle to
    fight in.

    Maintaining bounded fields reduces your maximum mana, but they last forever.
    Maintain the ones you need to and cancel fields once they have exhausted
    their use.

    Alarm Ward is the first field you get. It simply warns you (and others) when
    someone unwanted enters it. Many vaults, treasure rooms or other rooms
    containing important goodds or information will contain some form of an
    Alarm Ward.

    Explosive Ward is your second available field. It is usually placed on
    containers containing papers with sensitive information on it. If anybody
    tries to steal it, the papers will be destroyed even if the thief manages to
    get away.

    Sapping Ward is your final ward and one that greatly reduces the combat
    potential of any enemies entering it. The weakened condition is already bad
    enough, but grunts become stunned as well. Because a stunned target has no
    AP or RP, they will never be able to escape the ward while it lasts,
    essentially permanently disabling them for the encounter.

    Through hidden wards, you are able to hide your fields. With Disable Magic,
    you are able to disable other fields making Warding Mages good for
    infiltration as well.

      description: >-
        A ward that can be placed on a normal-sized room or can be combined to
        ward off a house or larger area. Each ward can cover a 40ft radius. For
        each Alarm Ward placed in the same area as another Alarm Ward, this
        radius increases by 40ft (For example, 120ft with 3 Alarm Wards). If
        someone other than you passes through the ward, the ward triggers
        creating a loud ringing noise that persists until the ward is disabled.
        Casting this takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted casting. Once triggered,
        the field remains active for 5 more minutes before vanishing. At the
        time of casting, you may choose people that can pass through the barrier
        without triggering it. If not triggered, Alarm Ward lasts until you
        remove it. For each Alarm Ward you maintain, your maximum mana is
        reduced by 1. This is considered a tier 1 ward.

        You may choose to hide your Bounded Fields when casting them by making a
        Stealth check. The casted ward uses the result of your Stealth check.
        Hidden Bounded Fields cannot be seen with Sense Magic without a
        successful perception or insight check.

        A ward that can be placed on a door or medium-sized container of some
        sort. If someone other than you opens the door or container, the ward
        triggers creating a loud noise and dealing Heavy Fire Damage to all
        creatures in a 10ft radius around the container. All items inside the
        container (if any) also take this damage. Once triggered, the bounded
        field vanishes. Casting this takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted casting.
        You may at the time of casting choose a number of people equal to your
        Focus that can also open the container or door without triggering the
        ward. If not triggered, Explosive Ward lasts until you remove it. For
        each Explosive Ward you maintain your maximum mana is reduced by 2. This
        is considered a tier 2 ward.

        A ward that can be placed on a normal-sized room or can be combined to
        ward off a house or larger area. Each ward can cover a 20ft radius and
        for each Sapping Ward placed in the same area as another Sapping Ward,
        this radius increases by 20ft (For example, 60ft with 3 Sapping Wards)
        If someone other than you enters the area, they must make a save against
        your Potency or become Weakened. Non-heroic units that enter the area
        must make a save or become Stunned instead. These conditions last while
        they remain inside the field and for an additional 2 rounds after
        exiting it. Casting this takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted casting. Once
        triggered, the field remains active for 5 more minutes before vanishing.
        You may at the time of casting choose a number of people equal to your
        Focus that can enter the area without triggering the ward. If not
        triggered, Sapping Ward lasts until you remove it. While it remains,
        your maximum mana is reduced by 2 for each instance of Sapping Ward you
        have active. This is considered a tier 2 ward.
