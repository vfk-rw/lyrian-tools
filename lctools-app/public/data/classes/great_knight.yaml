    First fielded by Northi not long after Hussars were becoming common on the
    battlefield, the Great Knight represented the quintessential heavy cavalry.
    With knight and mount both clad in heavy armor, the Great Knight was made to
    be a mobile barrier. Able to interpose their armored bulk for their allies
    and even project that protection into an aura around them, Great Knights
    were able to push through even the most heavily contested battlefields for
    their allies. And while there were countless stories throughout the ages of
    heavily armored knights turning the tides of battle, there were none as
    debated as the story of Sir Owain Morgan and Dame Madeline Benoit.

    As told and accepted by Northi historians, Sir Owain Morgan was a dogfolk
    Great Knight without peer. Honorable beyond reproach and an unstoppable
    juggernaut on the battlefield, he had a list of successful battles
    attributed to him that stretched the imagination. In fact, detractors of Sir
    Owain’s tale would often point out that he must have surely known
    teleportation and time travel magics to be at so many battles at once. What
    could not be disputed was that Sir Owain certainly existed, his name
    recorded in the annals of the Bastion Knights. But his most debated feat was
    one that involved a Westrian knight, Dame Madeline Benoit, and the
    proliferation of Mage Knights into Northi’s military.

    While there were many versions of the tale, the most accepted one in Northi
    followed a series of reasonably set in stone facts. During one of the many
    border skirmishes common between Northi and Westria as they vied for control
    over the Nuren Plains, it was said that Sir Owain led a counter attack
    against a Westrian skirmishing force. He led his men to victory and
    successfully captured many knights to ransom back to Westria, including Dame
    Madeline Benoit. While most of the knights and men at arms were released
    back to their homes, Dame Madeline was kept for one very important reason:
    to teach Northi the art of the Mage Knight. Historians for the Era of
    Knights could often be incited into argument around the idea as there were
    as many accounts for how Northi gained access to the skills of Westria’s
    holy knights as there were historians to argue about them.

    But what was almost universally accepted as the truth was that Sir Owain,
    disgusted with his peers and superiors' lack of any decency to release Dame
    Madeline back to her family, took it upon himself to free the woman. There
    was little historical accounting of where they went or what they did but
    there were legends of a pair of knights wandering Lyr and helping those in
    need. And while those actions had never definitively been attributed to Sir
    Owain and Dame Madeline, what couldn’t be denied was when they both turned
    back up in solid historical record.

    They would found Morgan Ranch in what would later become Dacquoise, near the
    future site of the city of Madeline. It was there that the retired knights,
    happily married for an unclear amount of time, had begun taking on students
    and ranch hands to teach the art of horsemanship, knighthood, and magic.
    While the ranch itself did not last into modern times, the house itself was
    maintained and the legacy of chivalry was upheld by the descendants of those
    students. Collectively, and informally, they called themselves the Knights
    of Morgan and dedicated themselves to helping those in need whenever and
    wherever they were found.

    The great knight is a mounted tank class that excels in fights with many
    different engagements.

    Intercept is your main tool in getting around the battlefield, allowing you
    to ride to an allies aid. If you move to an ally far away enough, you can
    even use Trample and do some damage with it. Note that your movement is not
    a sidestep, you do provoke attacks of opportunity with it.

    Rescue & Drop lets you save an ally from a bad situation and ride them out
    to safety. You can also drop them immediately to another square nearby to
    break them free from being surrounded or to let them move away without
    provoking.

    Your Secret Art: Moving Castle is an aura that reduces damage by 3 in a
    small aura around you. This can be massive when fighting against a group of
    non-heroic enemies, reducing the damage your allies take by a large amount.
    You can also move for free once per turn to reposition and potentially help
    allies in two completely different positions at the same time.

    Shared Defense is a simple tool that helps you protect your mount from AoE
    attacks.
