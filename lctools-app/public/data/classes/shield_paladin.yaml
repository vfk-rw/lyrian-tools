    allies safe.
  guide: 'The shield paladin is a tank that focuses on blocking and temporary HP.

    Through their Aura of Protection, they allow their allies to block against attacks
    even if their Block is normally too low to be usable. This does cost mana and
    it requires your ally to block, so communication with your allies is key.

    With Holy Shield, you can convert AP into defense, gaining both a high Block potentially
    allowing you to block even heavy attacks and a decent check of temporary HP. You
    do give up damage by using too much AP on this, so it is not always the best option
    to dump all your AP into it.

    Divine Smite is a more offensive way to gain temporary hit points. It does require
    landing the heavy attack, but it can be used both on yourself or an ally.

    Shield paladins can also heal themselves or ally through their Lay on Hands ability.
    It''s efficient both mana and AP wise, with the only drawback being that it only
    has a touch range. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity however, so you
    don''t need to worry about disengaging from the fight before healing.'
