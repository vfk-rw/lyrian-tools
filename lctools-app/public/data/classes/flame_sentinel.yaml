    enemies.
  guide: 'Flame Sentinels support their allies primarily through offense. Flame Weapon
    grants a small power boost to a weapon of an ally and lets them deal fire damage,
    which may be important against some enemies. Controlled Blaze will not prevent
    your allies from setting things on fire, so be careful when giving it out when
    flameable material is around.

    Flame Shield allows you to do damage after an ally takes damage. It costs 1 RP,
    but its fully unavoidable and full pierce damage. If you hang out in the back
    and don''t have much use for your RP, this can be an excellent way to spend it.

    Flame Infusion is a situational ability. Against certain enemies it''s extremely
    powerful and against others, its a detriment.

    Flame Wall is a strong zoning tool, able to cut off a large portion of a fight.
    You can also use it as a damage tool, dropping it right on top of enemies to force
    them to use an RP. If they choose not to do so, or if they have no more RP to
    spent, then it is effectively a Sure Hit attack once their turn starts.'
