  guide: 'A brawler is a scrappy fighter that takes hits to dish them out.

    Counter Stance is a risky stance in which you cannot react to attacks through
    normal means, but you get to make a counter attack afterwards. A brawler has to
    carefully weigh his options before entering the stance, as he cannot end it until
    his next turn starts. One option is to only use it when you are already low on
    RP, as being unable to Dodge or Block has little effect when you lack the RP to
    do so to begin with.

    To help survive while countering, a brawler has access to Vital Drive II. While
    the healing itself isn''t the most efficient, being able to use it as reaction
    allows you to stay standing after attacks that should have knocked you out.

    Suckerpunch is an amazing opening move, if you can land it. It can only be used
    when already in melee range of an enemy at the start of the encounter, so getting
    up in someone''s face before you fight them is a good move.

    Knockout Punch instantly takes out grunt level enemies and leaves them alive,
    which sets it apart from similar abilities. Useful for when you need to interrogate
    them after. The 4 AP cost for a heavy attack makes it risky to use against enemies
    who still have RP left, so ideally you let your allies set you up before using
    it.

    Wind-up punch is an attack meant to punch through tough guards. While it lacks
    the full pierce or guard crush properties, by adding all the damage together into
    1 big attack, the guard is less valuable than what is it applied multiple times.'
