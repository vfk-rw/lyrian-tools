  guide: 'The high priest has strong out of combat healing thanks to their Tranquil
    Prayers. If possible, you will want to delay healing near the end of a fight and
    save your mana to use it after combat ends.

    Cure Touch II is a massive heal with an equally big mana cost. It''s very powerful
    when an ally is low on hit points, but it may leave you out of options in the
    future.

    Purify is a simple spell that lets you remove a negative effect from an ally.
    While the cost is low, it does still cost mana so only remove effects that matter.

    Radiant Halo is another spell with a high mana cost. It heals all allies, but
    the range may be limiting if the party is split up in a fight. You can also cast
    it by using RP, which can be a lifesaver when you need to top of your allies after
    a powerful AoE attack.

    Finally, Walking Church is a secret art that effectively makes a target immune
    to damage for one turn. There will always be a use for this ability in a fight,
    so save a mana and RP for it until you need it.'
