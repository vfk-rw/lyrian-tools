  description: >-
    The Hoarfrosts are Cryomancers who’ve mastered the chilling power of ice,
    tracing their origins back to a legendary mage named Mirane. She was the
    first to truly perfect the art of Cryomancy during her journey through the
    eastern Tundra. Her story took a dramatic turn when she faced off against a
    powerful Fiend. In that intense battle, Mirane developed her ultimate spell,
    the Eternal Mirane Cage. This incredible spell froze the Fiend in place for
    ten long years, giving an army of adventurers the time they needed to arrive
    and finally take it down.

    Mirane’s magic didn’t just fade into history—it’s been passed down through
    the generations to future Hoarfrosts. Those who follow in her footsteps wear
    a snowflake emblem, just like Mirane did, and many of them embark on their
    own journeys to the Tundra that now bears her name.

    Eternal Mirane Cage is a legendary ability, but it’s not something you’ll
    use all the time. It’s perfect for when you need to subdue enemies who just
    won’t give up, making Hoarfrosts a great choice for missions where taking
    down targets alive is the goal.

    Frost Driver is an excellent follow-up move that turns a slow into a full-on
    root, setting up your team for devastating AoE attacks and utility plays.
    Just be aware of its limitation against flying enemies—it won’t be as
    effective there.

    White Thunder is a clever setup move that transforms your Glacial Walls into
    potential bombs. It forces enemies to think twice before getting too close,
    giving you control over the battlefield.

    When things get dicey, Glacial Bastion is your panic button, but it’s not
    something to use without thought. While it shields you, it can also give
    enemies the chance to position themselves around you, potentially trapping
    you. If you see them making a move for a big strike, use White Thunder while
    encased, since you can’t defend yourself while you’re in the ice.

    Lastly, the Hoarfrost’s Secret Art, Whiteout, is a powerful tool that
    reduces accuracy for everyone on the battlefield and can be activated right
    at the start of an encounter. It’s especially useful if you’re ambushed or
    under heavy pressure, buying your team some defensive turns to regroup and
    reposition. Just keep in mind that enemies with Frost Immunity or Ice Cold
    are unaffected by it, just like you.
