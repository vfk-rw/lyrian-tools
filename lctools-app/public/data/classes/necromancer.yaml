    Necromancers manipulate the dead. Feared and hated by most people, and often
    justifiably so.
  guide: >-
    Necromancers are a special class that has a focus on raising undead to fight
    for them. These undead, zombies or skeletons, are not strong by themselves
    but can be a threat once they gather. The undead they raise do not stay
    after an arc is finished. This means that necromancer starts an arc of weak
    until they find an opportunity to raise some.

    The undead group themselves can be used in multiple ways. They add free
    damage while they are alive, so keeping them that way is good. At the same
    time, they can also be used as disposable creatures that can be used to hold
    off a powerful enemy to buy yourself team to heal or retreat. They are also
    pretty hard to fully kill off, but keep them away from multi-hit attacks and
    AoE holy damage.

    Raise Undead can be used either during combat to get a group going, or you
    can chain cast it once a combat is over. Soulreap combines the raising of
    the undead with a heavy attack, allowing you to build up your forces without
    wasting AP or letting you get two active in 1 turn, provided there's already
    a corpse somewhere.

    Corpse Explosion uses your raised undead as a resource. It is a powerful aoe
    for the cost which can be further empowered by using more corpses. This
    trades long term fight potential for a quick gain and it may not be worth
    blowing too many zombies on if you can't restock afterwards.

    Corpse Domination lets you raise an enemy you killed to help you in the
    fight. It's not worth using unless it's on a heroic target, but adding
    another body to the battlefield on your side can swing the battle in your
    favor. It's powerful in fights against multiple heroic enemies.

    Speak with dead is an out of combat utility ability. The usefulness on it
    depends heavily on the situation, as well as the GM.

    One last thing to keep in mind as a necromancer player is that most people
    are not fond of zombies and skeletons. If you stroll into town with a small
    undead army behind you, don't expect a warm welcome in most places.

        You attempt to communicate with the soul of a person who has died
        recently. This requires you to perform a ritual that takes an hour, that
        must be performed next to the corpse or where the person died. You must
        be aware of the identity of the person youâ€™re trying to contact.
        Finally, you must have a tool such as an ouija board that allows the
        spirit to communicate with you.


        Even if the ritual succeeds, the spirit is not forced to answer your
        questions if hostile to you or it might answer in cryptic ways.

        You raise the target under your command. A target raised in this way is
        treated as a non-heroic unit that takes its own actions, however it will
        try to act in a way that is most helpful to you in the fight. 


        The raised target keeps all of its stats and abilities it had in life,
        though it only starts with half its maximum health and whatever mana it
        had left over when it died. 


        This summon lasts until the end of the encounter or until its HP reaches
        0, upon which it immediately dies again and cannot be raised again in
        any way.
