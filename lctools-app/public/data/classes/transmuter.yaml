  description: "In the dust of an artisan's workshop or in the open clearings of a logging company, the hum and chirps of transmutation can be heard. \_Transmutation is an art, a magic as ancient as Lyr. \_Long before the shadows of the great calamity, Transmuters were scholars who questioned the very nature of existence. \_This pursuit led to a mastery over both destruction and creation, spinning the threads of reality itself into a tapestry.\nTransmutation is the second branch of alchemy and created a revolution in society. \_It replaced primitive methods such as smelting and manual refinementâ€”which previously had artisans sweating over blazing crucibles into the dark hours of the night. \_It isn't uncommon for master craftsmen to have a Transmuter in their employ or as a partner, processing material in the atelier or even helping with the crafting itself. \_In fact, nowadays there is rarely a town across Lyr without at least one person versed in the basics of this ancient art.\nTransmuters manipulate matter at its core, unraveling its threads and rebuilding them into entire new forms. \_They can shatter stone into dust, or create small figurines from blocks of wood. \_The control of Transmutation is only limited by skill and imagination. Transmutation is the second branch of Alchemy, which itself is one of the great pillars of Arcane Magic.\nYet with great power comes great peril. \_Those who understand Transmutation know that creation and destruction are two sides of the same coin. \_It requires a sound mind and body to walk the delicate balance, making Transmuters some of the most respected Artisans in any community they are in."

    Transmuter is a class that helps crafting for other classes and provided
    utility in combat.

    Transmute weapon is a simple ability that lets you create a weapon for
    yourself or ally. While you probably don't want to rely entirely on this for
    your equipment as it costs mana and may not always work, it's good for
    providing an emergency backup or if there happens to be special material
    nearby.

    Transmute wall is a reactionary defense against a ranged attack. Because
    you'll be able to see the damage you're about to take in most cases, it will
    be easy to judge how much mana you should spend on this. Because it's a wall
    and not you blocking, this can help you defend against full pierce type of
    attacks.

    Transmute terrain is a versatile ability that lets you create walls,
    bridges, ledges and other terrain. You can spend a lot of mana on this at
    once, allowing for some creative use such as completely boxing in a
    character, pushing yourself 60ft into the air for a sniper position, pushing
    enemies off a cliff and much more.

    Deconstruct is an interlude ability that lets you recycle useless items into
    usable material. Best to use it when you have a large amount of things piled
    up.

    In crafting, you have a few unique abilities as well as the ability to
    co-craft. This costs you nothing to do by default, so use it whenever you
    can. Two of your co-craft abilities do have a cost and you can also use them
    in your own crafts. Temperature Shock is useful early when you roll poorly
    to have a guaranteed number to your next roll. Once your bonus grows higher
    or if you need to gamble, Alchemic catch will be better as it uses the full
    bonus you have. If you're co crafting and don't want to spend money, you can
    just use bouncing ideas for a free small bonus. Finally ragequit is useful
    if you don't care about profit by itself and only want to make something
    big. You do lose a lot when using this, so avoid it unless you know what
    you're doing.
