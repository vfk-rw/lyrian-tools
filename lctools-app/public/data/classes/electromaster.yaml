  guide: 'Electromaster builds on the Electromancer, focusing around dealing damage
    and controlling the battlefield with their static.

    Lightning Strikes Twice punishes enemies who don’t position themselves properly
    by transferring any static to the targets they hit. Against clusters of enemies,
    this can chain into many applications.

    With Static Discharge, they can force this chain reaction even easier. Applying
    static on an enemy and then instantly discharging it gets the ball rolling quickly.

    Once the static is properly applied, they can begin to do AoE damage through thunderstorm.
    The damage is not particularly high, but it can hit many enemies. Note that it
    cannot be used indoors, making Electromasters more suited for outside combat.

    Against bosses or other scenarios where single target damage is required, they
    can use Static Overload. It requires static to be applied, but it does decent
    damage and dazes the target.

    When they activate their secret art Lightning Field, they become almost unapproachable
    for grunt level enemies. The constant unavoidable damage will shred through them
    in only a couple of turns.'
