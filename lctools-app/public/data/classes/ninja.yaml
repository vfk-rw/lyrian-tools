  guide: 'The ninja is a slippery ranged class that uses throwing weapons.

    Their first ranged option is the Kibaku Fuda Shuriken. It''s a fairly AP efficient
    attack, even if used against just a single target, but it is of course ideally
    tossed into a group of enemies.

    The Kage Shuriken no Jutsu is used against single targets. Unless they target
    chooses to block the first one, you are guaranteed that at least one of the attacks
    hits, making it good against dodgy targets.

    A lot of power of the ninja comes from their Bunshin Tai no Jutsu. It creates
    a copy that shares everything with the original body. It can be used in many different
    ways. For example, you can use the body double to threaten enemy ranged attackers.
    You don''t need to worry about overextending too much. If the enemy decides to
    retreat and collapse on you, you can simply dismiss the copy and escape from harm.
    You can also use it to flank enemies and hit them from where cover won''t protect
    them. The important here to keep in mind that is that you are never overextended
    with a clone. If you feel you are in danger, simply dismiss it.

    Another powerful defensive tool Ninjas have is Kawarimi no Jutsu. The RP cost
    is higher than normal, but it protects even against sure hit attacks and because
    you can hide and move, you are also safe from any future follow up attacks.'
