    The forgemaster retains their crafting focus and is able to craft higher
    quality items. With Inspired Finish you can add a large boost to your craft
    at the very end. However, you can't do anything else after that so you might
    have to take a risk and apply the bonuses early, then hope you roll high
    enough.

    Forged Knowledge II now work on the weapons of allies as well, though you
    still need to have made their weapon. it also maximizes all the damage dice,
    which can create a sizeable damage increase on a bad damage roll.

    Secret Art: Shatter is either a Sure Hit heavy attack that deals good
    damage, or if they block it you destroy their weapon. Powerful against
    enemies that uses weapons, but it won't have much use against non-humanoids.
