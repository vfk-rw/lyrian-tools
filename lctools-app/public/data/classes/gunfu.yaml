    Those who practice Gunfu are able to fight well from both range as well as
    in melee due to not suffering any penalties when firing in melee combat.
    They are able to weaken the enemy from range, then go in for the kill once
    theyâ€™ve come closer.

    Slide & Shoot is their gap closer that can be used to slip past the
    frontline to target the backline. It also starts their combo and should
    always be followed up with an unarmed attack for maximum value.

    Pistol Whip is counted as an unarmed attack and is thus a natural follow up
    that now costs 0 AP. The debuff it applies will help reduce the amount of
    attacks you face.

    After that, you can finish it up with a Point Blank Shot. It is not
    particularly effective against heavy armor, but it punishes dodgy characters
    extremely hard.

    Their Secret Art Whirling Death is an excellent clean up tool for grunt type
    enemies. Ideally it should be used when multiple enemies are already
    weakened. This will allow for multiple activations of its Killing Blow
    mechanic when you finish off the weak enemies and can keep shooting.
