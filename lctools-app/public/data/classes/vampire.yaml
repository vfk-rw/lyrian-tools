  guide: 'Vampires are a versatile class with a slight focus on unarmed combat.

    Vampire Bite is the only way that vampires can regenerate mana and using it whenever
    possible is required to keep your mana high. The high AP cost makes it hard to
    use in a straight up battle. You can combine it with Vampiric Fascination to remove
    one enemy from the battle. The chosen target will move towards you and you can
    easily follow it up with your bite on the next turn, dealing guaranteed full pierce
    damage. Action economy wise, this is still not very efficient though. In harder
    fights, it may be more worthwhile to fight normally at the start and only start
    looking for enemies to drain near the end of a fight.

    Cloak of Bats is a manaless teleport that can also be used offensively. The RP
    cost on it is higher than that of a basic defense, but the teleport lets you potentially
    avoid attacks that are undodgeable. Whether you''re stuck in bad terrain, about
    to get hit by an AoE effect or you need to get behind cover, Cloak of Bats will
    get you out of almost any bad situation.

    Blood Frenzy is your last resort move. While it lasts you become very difficult
    to kill, especially if enemies are low on RP and can''t avoid your attacks to
    prevent you from regaining health. It does however, lock you into a very specific
    set of actions. You can''t regain mana through vampire bite or switch to a ranged
    weapon to hit an enemy that''s far away. You also cannot turn it off manually,
    which may lead you to losing all your mana even when you no longer need the healing
    effect. This is especially devastating for a vampire, since mana regeneration
    is a problem for them.

    Vampire Shapeshift is a cheap utility tool that can be useful for infiltration
    and sneaking. Shapeshifting into a bat is also an easy way to gain access to flight
    to reach high ground.

    The last thing to keep in mind as a vampire is that your vampire bite is not just
    a combat ability. You are able to use it on willing targets without hurting them,
    though they still lose mana. You will have to convince them first though, someone
    charmed by Vampiric Fascination does not count as a willing person.'

      one you attack. If no enemies are within range, you must use your movement to
      move closer to the closest visible enemy until you can attack them.

      While under the effect of blood frenzy, you heal for half the damage you deal
      with your unarmed attacks.

      You cannot use Vampire Bite while under the effect of Blood Frenzy.

      This effect lasts until all visible enemies are dead or until your mana runs
      out. At the start of your turn, you lose 2 mana.'
