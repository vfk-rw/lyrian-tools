    As was common with most innovations that made radical leaps, the history of
    the Sky Knights was steeped in warfare. Like the development of the
    Cavalier, learning to take to the sky on the backs of winged mounts stemmed
    from a need to counter a threat. Aerial Mages from Sorthen had long since,
    and in some cases continue, dominated the skies as scouts, couriers, and as
    untouchable bombardment specialists. With no modern airships to deter them
    and no Aeromancers to threaten them, both Northi and Westria searched for a
    solution. Nearly simultaneously, the two countries developed their own
    methods.

    From the mountains and hills near Mount Merlin, Northi tamed the wild
    pegasi. Harpy hunters were the first to capture and tame the wild flying
    horses and harpy run ranches continue to produce the highest quality mounts
    with specialized breeds tailored for various tasks. A pegasus’s agility and
    speed in the air let the chimeran knights of Northi put up a challenge to
    Sorthen aerial units in terms of scouting, but their limited endurance and
    fragile wings made them less suited as couriers and frontline combatants.

    Westria took a nuisance that plagued their southeastern border along the
    mountains near Jav and turned it into a solution. Wyverns roosting in the
    mountains and forests were regularly dealt with by adventurers and knights
    but some enterprising (and foolhardy) beast tamers decided to attempt to
    tame newly hatched wyverns as companions. With some false starts, they
    succeeded and it wasn’t long before an interest in training them as mounts
    emerged. Slower and less nimble in the air than their pegasi counterparts, a
    wyvern’s thick scales and devastating Reginleiv made them much more suitable
    as flying heavy cavalry.

    To this day, there is little overlap in the Sky Knight forces of Northi and
    Westria. While each side failed to deploy units that could directly counter
    Aerial Mages, their arrival on the battlefield removed Sorthen’s complete
    dominance of the air. Modern Sky Knight adventurers utilize whatever type of
    mount that suits their style (or that they can afford) and continue to fill
    their historical roles as scouts, couriers, and aerial cavalry.

    The sky knight is a class that focuses on flying mounts. It is vulnerable to
    ranged attacks, but it has excellent target access. Despite being a tier 2
    class, it may not be accessible for everyone due to the high cost of pegasi
    and wyverns. A pegasus is faster, but wyverns are a lot more durable and
    with some offensive power.

    Air Stability helps manage the durability issues of the pegasus, allowing
    you to re-direct attacks like normal. The flight rules of you losing
    altitude still apply though. Aerial Loop can also help with this. It can be
    used if either you or your mount become the target and it affects both of
    you, useful for avoiding AoE attacks.

    Aerial Crashdown is your main tool of attacking the backline, moving you to
    the target and allowing your mount to make a heavy attack for just 2 AP. Be
    careful of getting stuck on the ground against melee enemies however, as you
    can't canter of your mounts attack.

    If you don't want to commit to an engagement, you can use Flyby attack.
    This, like Aerial Crashdown, also works with Trample, though getting trample
    value is harder with a flying mount.

    Your Secret Art: Mythical Awakening varies based on the type of flying mount
    you use. The pegasus one can be used both offensively to just deal damage,
    but also defensively if you're scared of being forced to the ground by
    arrows. You can just bellorophon to attack and move low enough that you
    won't get shot down. The wyvern's reginliev is best used on the same
    elevation as the enemy, as it will be hard to hit many targets with the line
    attack otherwise.
