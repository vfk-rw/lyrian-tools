    Chronofighter is a melee-focused class that uses time power to enhance their
    attacks.
  guide: >-
    Chronofighter is a complex class that relies in setting up future turns to
    take advantage of attacks from the past.

    Attacks from the past is a difficult ability to use. Because everything is
    exactly mirrored based of the position of your previous turn and you cannot
    move before using it, it comes down to planning and a bit of luck to make
    good use of. However, when it does, the result is amazing. Being able to
    double your attacks are almost no cost is incredibly powerful.

    Accelerating Strike is a tool that should be combined with the Delay
    encounter start action, which is free for a Chronofighter. This lets you
    loop enemies at a crucial point, letting you take two turns in a row before
    they can respond.

    Delayed Hit is a good tool getting around temporary guard buffs. The target
    can still Block the damage when it hits the turn later, but less intelligent
    creatures may get faked out by the weird nature of the attack and try to
    react to it from the start.

    Butterfly Effect is a ramping ability. The initial mana cost is extremely
    high and it is not until the third use that it becomes a good use. The total
    mana cost before it becomes free is 9 mana and it takes at least 3 turns of
    stacking. Keep this in mind before using it, as it is a heavy commitment and
    a big waste of mana if you can't get max value out of it. When a fight does
    last long though and you get to keep stacking it, it is one of the most
    powerful abilities that exists.

        hit, even if it was guarded, the target takes Heavy Damage at the start
        of your next turn. (This delayed damage is calculated of the target’s
        Guard at the time it’s applied, not when the attack hit)
