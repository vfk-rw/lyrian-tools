  description: Zen Warriors are mobile monks with both offensive and defensive capabilities.
  guide: 'The Zen Warrior follows up from the monk and gives them some much needed
    mobility. Walking away from the Serene Water Stance will no longer instantly save
    you.

    Ki Blast II gives you the option to use a Light or Precise attack. This is useful
    when already in Serene Water stance, since you can follow it up with Flying Kick.

    Flying Kick can be used immediately after a Ki Blast has hit and places you next
    to the target. Because it then reduces the AP cost of Strike of Still Water by
    1, you can do a Precise Ki Blast→Flying Kick→Strike of Still Water combo.

    Ki Burst is a damage increase that can be used after you''ve hit an enemy with
    an attack. Mostly used for adding small points of damage when an enemy barely
    survives.

    Redirected Force takes advantage of the high dodge you will have in serene water
    stance. You can turn heavy attacks that miss you into attacks the enemy must respond
    to, or may be completely unable to avoid even when reacting to it.

    Secret Art: True Serenity is basically a guaranteed dodge for an entire turn unless
    the enemy uses sure hit attacks. Due to the +17 bonus that applies even when not
    dodging, even lock-on attacks will find it near impossible to hit you. As a bonus,
    you also enter Serene Water Stance from it. Best used when you about to take a
    lot of attacks in a single turn.'
