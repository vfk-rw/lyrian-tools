    Saboteurs combine scouting tools with some gadgets and explosives they can
    use in combat.

    Presence Concealment protects you from certain magical tracking tools.
    Scouting Ahead is useful when sneakily trying to move through a dungeon or
    other dangerous place, allowing your group to move stealthily even when not
    everyone in the group has put points into stealth.

    Chemical Explosive is a bomb that can be used to blow up many different
    things. Blowing a hole through a wall, or just blowing up a house straight
    up are both possible. You can only use it once per arc, so you do need to
    put in a bit of thought before committing to it. It can deal a lot of damage
    if it hits a person, but the detonation time is too long for it to see use
    in combat.

    Flash Bomb is effectively a free flashbang flask that allows a save. Daze is
    pretty powerful when you can inflict it on multiple people, tossing a flash
    bomb every turn can be worth it, even against just a single enemy.

    Wire Sweep is another potentially powerful CC tool. Because it is a save
    instead of an attack, enemies with low toughness may find it hard to defend
    against.

        You place a Chemical Explosive package that detonates after one minute.
        The explosion has a 15 ft radius and deals Double Heavy damage. The
        package makes an obvious noise after it has been planted that can be
        heard within the radius. The explosive charge deals 5x damage against
        inanimate objects. You can create a Chemical Explosive during an
        interlude phase for free, but can only carry one at a time. The check to
        disable a Chemical Explosive is equal to 20 + 2 x Power of the creator.
