  description: 'There was once a time when pure, unbridled magic was the most powerful
    force in the land. A single mage could hold off entire enemy battalions with ease.
    But that changed with the invention of Artificing. Suddenly, battles began to
    shift, with more and more fighters targeting mages directly, exploiting their
    difficulty in close combat. As the martial world integrated rapid uses of internal
    mana and artifices, mages found themselves on the defensive, facing enemies up
    close like never before.

    In response to this new threat, the first Battle Mages emerged from Northi. These
    warriors developed a unique spell weave, while incredibly mana-intensive, it allowed
    them to cast spells rapidly, even in the heat of close-range combat. This innovation
    took full advantage of their physical prowess as Chimera, turning them into formidable
    opponents both near and far.

    The invention of the "Shooting Form" further enhanced their capabilities. This
    technique allowed Battle Mages to imbue their melee weapons with the properties
    of staves, enabling a seamless transition between long-range spellcasting and
    close-quarters combat. With this versatility, Battle Mages became a force to be
    reckoned with, combining the raw power of magic with the physicality of martial
    arts.'
  guide: 'The battlemage is a competent switch striker, being able to swap between
    melee and ranged combat instantly. Weapon Swap has no cost and can be used even
    on an enemies turn, allowing you to swap to melee form if an enemy thinks he can
    just walk away.

    Mage Armor gives a lot of flexibility which is normally unavailable. When fighting
    a horde of weak monsters, you can start in heavy armor and watch their attacks
    bounce off almost harmlessly. Against a hard hiting boss, starting in light for
    maximum evasion might be better. If you made a mistake or the situation changes,
    a 2 AP cost is an acceptable price to pay for a change. Your RP changes as well,
    so starting in heavy armor and then moving to lighter armor as the fight progresses
    is a valid strategy.

    Dragon Breaks The Ranks is a long range gap closer that moves you forward with
    devastating force. The high AP cost may make it hard to use, but don''t overlook
    the AoE damage part of the charge. It can also be used to escape from a tough
    situation as it gives flight, lots of movement and you don''t provoke, provided
    you have a target you can charge to.

    Because the battle mage wants to spend time in melee combat, battle cast is a
    necessity to be able to cast spells without putting yourself at risk.

    Circle Swing is their main melee attack. It allows you to create space and follow
    up with a cheaper spell or ranged attack. Be aware that you may still provoke
    attacks from other enemies you are engaged with, even if you main target is now
    unable to.

    The most common weapon for a battle mage is a polearm. The extra range on attacks
    makes it easier for it to weave melee and spells without provoking.'

      giving the same benefits and penalties. Does not stack with other armor, apply

      not require proficiency of any sort and does not cost any Burden to wear and

      If Mage Armor is active, you may spend 2 AP to change its type or to remove
      it. If changing to a heavier armor, your current RP is reduced by the same amount
      as your maximum RP. If changing to a lighter armor, your current RP is increased
      by the same amount as your maximum RP. Your RP may go below 0 when doing this.'
