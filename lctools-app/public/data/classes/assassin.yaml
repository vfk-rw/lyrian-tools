    Assassins trace their origins back to the lawless city of Telsin, deep in
    the Southern Desert. With little military power of their own and relying
    mostly on the harsh desert environment for protection, the people of Telsin
    developed less conventional methods of defense. Assassins emerged from this
    need, honing their skills in reconnaissance and studying their targets with
    meticulous care, mentally preparing themselves before executing the perfect
    kill.

    Their reputation for precision and effectiveness quickly spread, becoming so
    legendary that other nations started to take notice. Before long, these
    nations began hiring assassins of their own, both to eliminate key targets
    and to counter the deadly expertise of other assassins.
  guide: >-
    The assassin functions best when they get the jump on the enemy. Their
    Inconspicuous key ability is key for this, as it lets them get a surprise
    attack even if the rest of the party isn't quite as sneaky.

    When they get the surprise, they can use their Death Mark ability. It gives
    them a small benefit on killing the target, but the real use is opening up
    the target to their other abilities.

    Devastating Strike IV is the first of those abilities. Similar to the normal
    devastating strike, but it does guaranteed maximum damage.

    Their Secret Art: Assassinate is the second of those abilities. While a
    sure-hit and full pierce heavy attack is already strong by itself, it shows
    its true potential against enemies who are unaware of you. Due to this
    nature, it is a rare secret art ability that must be activated in the first
    round or lose power.

    Study Target has minor issues in a direct fight, though getting a lock-on
    heavy attack for 4 combined AP is not bad against dodgy enemies. When
    there's a temporary lull in the action, for example through an acolyte
    sanctuary barrier, setting up a study target before hand will give you an
    edge when the fighting resumes. It can also be used to force a Death Mark
    onto an enemy if you were unable to get the surprise round before. However,
    this is very AP inefficient so it should most likely be avoided in most
    cases.

        You mentally mark a target for death by applying Death Mark, opening
        them up to your Assassin abilities. When you reduce a character marked
        by Death Mark to 0 HP or lower, you may move up to your Speed and take
        the Hide action for 0 RP. This movement does not provoke attacks of
        opportunity.
