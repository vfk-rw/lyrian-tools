    Pyromancer specialize in dealing fire damage and setting things on fire.

    Fireball is one of their signature abilities, dealing damage in a small AoE.
    It has decent range making it good for dealing with packs of enemies before
    they can get close.

    Incendiary Ray is strong when used in a choke point. If the enemies all line
    up through a single corridor, one ray can hit many enemies at the same time.
    It can hit allies as well however, so make sure they're okay with it before
    you start blasting.

    After dealing Fire damage, you can spend an RP to set people on fire. While
    using it against a single enemy may not seem like a worthwhile trade, as RP
    is generally more valuable, disrupting the actions of a boss type enemy by
    lowering their AP by 1 can still be valuable. When using mana to use it
    against multiple enemies, it becomes a more appealing choice. Especially
    since grunts lack AP to begin with, meaning they will spend half their AP on
    removing the burn. If they choose not to remove it, the burn is likely to
    kill them after their turn ends.

    The Secret Art: Pyroblast is a heavy nuke. Where most of these types of
    hard-hitting abilities basically require the target to be out of RP,
    pyroblast has a second use condition if an enemy decided not to remove the
    burn you put on it. If neither of the conditions are met, it's probably best
    to wait.
