    The peltast makes throwing weapons a valid choice for a main weapon. The
    boomerang key ability makes it so you no longer have to keep paying AP to
    draw more weapons. The peltast ideally wants to play close to the enemy and
    isn't afraid of melee combat.

    Long Toss gives you a long range option. The range of throwing weapons is
    normally a bit low, so this can be used when you would be out of range to
    attack normally.

    Rappelling Dagger is a movement option that can also deal damage. Useful
    when you have to engage an enemy that's not too far away and it can be used
    to obtain high ground by rappelling into a tree or on top of a building.

    Fan of Knives is a point blank AoE that can be used even when engaged in
    melee. It will require you to get close to the enemy before you can use it.

    Stab & Throw is an AP efficient attack that requires you to be in melee,
    plus to have another enemy nearby.

        does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Can be used against non-living
