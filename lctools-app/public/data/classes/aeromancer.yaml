    The first Aeromancer corps were born in Northi, created as a direct response
    to Sorthen's formidable Ace Aerial Mage squads. While the Catfolk had a
    stronghold on the ground with their incredible speed, the Fae and Sorthen
    flyers posed a constant threat from above. That is, until a cunning Catfolk
    mage named Nicole Mimi changed the game.

    Mimi took a magical art that was once considered weak, Aeromancy, and turned
    it into a force to be reckoned with. By destabilizing the air itself, she
    crafted powerful gales and sudden downbursts, effectively disrupting air
    superiority. What was once seen as a lesser magic became a devastating
    weapon under her mastery.

    To this day, Aeromancers from all corners of the world study Mimi's tomes,
    learning to command the sky just as she did. They've turned Aeromancy into
    an art of its own, capable of twisting the winds and reshaping the
    battlefield.

    Aeromancers take on a more controllery striker role, displacing enemies
    while attacking them. They are very dangerous when near cliffs or other
    hazards. Their difficulty lies in the importance of their positioning.
    Knockbacks do damage if the target can not be moved the full distance, so
    knocking enemies into walls can add a decent amount of damage.

    Wind Burst is a low investment ability that provides significant
    displacement. While using it near hazards is the obvious choice, it can also
    be used to free up space for allies or to push the enemy closer to your
    allies so they can spend more AP on attacking instead of moving.

    Wind Scatter is an almost pure disruption tool. It makes further AoE's
    impossible, so careful use is required to not disrupt your allies. A good
    Wind Scatter however, can put significant distance between the front most
    and backmost enemy of a formation, which allows for targets to be isolated
    and picked off.

    Wind Buffet is a more defensive knockback, forcing enemies away from you. Be
    careful, as it provokes attacks of opportunities and can hit allies.

    Downburst is a simple, but extremely powerful anti-air tool. With high range
    and lock-on, an aeromancer is a aerial mage or flying monster's worst
    nightmare.
