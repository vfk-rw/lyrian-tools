    The Shadow Thief is a stealthy and cunning character, specializing in
    thievery, deception, and infiltration. They excel at slipping into enemy
    territory undetected and stealing valuable items or information, using their
    quick reflexes and agility to escape undetected.
  guide: >-
    The shadow thief is a utility class that works best during the night. Every
    single ability they have has higher than normal mana costs during the day,
    but lower than average during the night. Ideally, you only want to fight
    during the night though of course this isn't always an option.

    Shadowstep at night is better than normal movement. Not only do you move
    further or the AP cost, with it being a teleport you ignore attacks of
    opportunity, difficult terrain and other hassles. During the day, it's a
    worse Fae Flash. Still usable if you need to teleport, but not worth the
    mana cost in a lot of cases.

    Vanish during the night is a 1 RP hide action. This has some use cases,
    allowing you to make more attack while taking advantage of the stealth
    bonus. The use case by itself doesn't change much during the day, as the RP
    cost is a bigger limiting factor than the mana cost in most cases.

    Shadow Cloak not only gives you a stealth bonus, it also lets you stealth
    even when you don't have cover or concealment. This makes the Vanish ability
    a lot more useful, allowing you to stealth in the middle of nowhere,
    although it requires a high stealth skill bonus. It's a one time cost that
    lasts until the end of the encounter, so it's still usable even during the
    day. It's also just good for sneaking into places, especially when combined
    with Shade Form.

    Shade Form is a primarily out of combat exploration tool, though it has some
    use in combat too by being able to move through enemy spaces. It is almost
    unusable during the day due to its upkeep cost though.
