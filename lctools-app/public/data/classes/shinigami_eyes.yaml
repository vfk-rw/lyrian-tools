    Shinigami Eyes are mystic eyes that allow the user to perceive the death of
    things. This manifests in the shape of lines and points on a creature’s
    body, which can be cut or stabbed.
  guide: >-
    The Shinigami Eyes are a mystic eye ability. When you activate your death
    perception, you immediately see the HP % of all enemies within sight. It may
    cost a mana, but it gives information a lot faster than relying on Status
    Assessment skills.

    With the True Death passive ability, you immediately become a counter to any
    sort of healer. There's nothing to heal when their maximum HP is reduced by
    the same amount as their HP.

    Line of Death is a light attack that punishes armored targets that think
    they can ignore light attacks. It won't do much extra against targets
    without a high guard.

    Point of Death does consistent damage against enemies below half HP. Even
    against targets without high guard, it may still be worth using sometimes
    for its maximum damage property when you need to secure a kill and can't
    risk rolling low on damage.

    Secret Art: Seventeen Dissection is a secret art that does not cost any
    mana, making it usable in every fight. Against heroic enemies, it is just a
    guaranteed 17 damage. It can be useful if they are still sitting on RP but
    are low on HP. If they are out of RP, then just attacking normally may do
    more damage. Against any type of grunt, it is just an instant kill no
    matter. Useful against grunts that have a lot of hit points.
