  description: The Gunslinger is a ranged combat specialist who excels in the use
    of firearms, particularly pistols. They are skilled marksmen, able to hit their
    targets with deadly accuracy and speed.
  guide: 'The gunslinger takes control of the fight from the start with their Quickdraw
    ability. It''s only a light attack, but it''s a free attack that can''t be reacted
    to, so it''s free early damage. Because it''s an encounter start ability, it is
    one of the few things that lets you act before enemy with ‘First Shot’ initiative
    bonus can take their action.

    Ricochet is a simple attack that can be used to bypass light cover. If an enemy
    is using light cover, there''s little reason not to use it.

    Warning Shot costs a fair bit of mana, but gaining Trick Attack can help you secure
    hits. Grunts are unable to react to them, so you can snipe one hiding behind cover
    with a warning shot + ricochet combo.

    For their Secret Art: Fan the hammer you''ll probably want to bring a spare pistol.
    It is a relatively close range ability and the high AP cost makes it hard to move
    and shoot if you don''t get extra AP from somewhere, but it can do a large amount
    of damage. A single reaction will affect all 4 shots, so its something only to
    be used against a target that has exhausted their RP.'
