    The fencer is a highly mobile 1v1 specialist. Their fancy footwork allows
    them to reposition on the battlefield and away from other attackers, keeping
    them focused on their target.

    Parry is their most important ability. It costs 1 mana, but the RP cost is
    easily refunded if you use it against light attacks or against someone
    weaker than you. Because it effectively is a damage check with your focus
    instead of power, you should be careful in using it against high power
    enemies, especially if they use a heavy weapon. A heavy attack from those is
    likely to break through your parry and a dodge might be the better option.

    Riposte is the follow up to a parry. It costs 1 RP, so it does eat into your
    defenses but it is an otherwise free Heavy attack. Just keep your RP in mind
    before using it.

    Lunge helps fencer on fighting multiple enemies a bit. If an enemy is barely
    out of range, you can use your Lunge for extra range than fancy footwork to
    get in range. It can also be useful against rogueish characters who think
    they are safe after an evasive maneuver. Simply activate lunge and hit them
    from 10ft away.

    Precise Thrust is an attack that's best used against heavily armored
    targets. Dodging is usually the preferred answer to a Heavy attack, so this
    may not see much use except against the most armored of enemies.

        Roll your Heavy Weapon Damage, but add your Focus instead of Power to
        the roll and treat that as your guard against the attack targeting you.
        If Parry reduces the damage to 1 or lower, you regain 1 RP (cannot go
        higher than your max RP). On hit effects and maces do not gain their
        effect if you reduce the damage to 0.
