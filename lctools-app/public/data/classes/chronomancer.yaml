  description: 'Chronomancers are rare mages who wield the mysterious power of time
    itself. They can slow down moments, speed them up, or even rewind them, turning
    the tide of battle in ways that few can predict or understand. In a world where
    such magic is almost unheard of, Chronomancers stand out as an often feared force.

    Their magic traces back to one source: Chroma-Daria Lichtvog, a wandering Witch
    and Thaumaturge who’s been around for over a thousand years—at least, that’s what
    the stories say. Daria teaches her craft on a whim, picking students when it suits
    her. Most Chronomancers have either learned directly from her or stumbled across
    her ancient writings, devoting their lives to uncovering the secrets within.

    Running into a Chronomancer means you’re up against someone who can twist the
    flow of time itself. Whether they’ve been taught by the Witch herself or have
    painstakingly studied her elusive texts, their powers are as astonishing as they
    are unsettling.'
  guide: 'Chronomancers are all about controlling the battlefield, and their abilities
    make them a vital part of any team. When you’re not sure what move to make, use
    Store Time to bank it for later.  Having one extra action the next turn can open
    up powerful combinations, or help to strike during a more opportune time.

    Slow is a go-to for dealing with those quick and slippery foes. It never misses,
    so you can lock them down or force them to waste their precious resources on defense.
    Accelerando is a lifesaver for a teammate who got a bad roll on initiative or
    just needs a speed boost to make an important move.

    The heart of a Chronomancer’s toolkit is Haste. This ability lets your ally get
    the most out of their buffs or strike during a crucial moment. In a pinch, Galaxy
    Stop is your trump card. It time stops all the grunt enemies on the battlefield,
    giving your party the breathing room to either regroup or take out a few foes
    while they’re defenseless.

    While a Chronomancer is great at supporting and controlling the flow of battle,
    they don’t do so well on their own. They shine best when they’re working in tandem
    with their allies in nearly any party setup, using their versatile abilities to
    keep momentum.'
