    Guardians are heavily armored fighters that specialize in defense for both
    themselves and their allies.
  guide: >-
    The guardian is a defender that wants to reduce damage through high
    toughness and heavy armor. They get access to this heavy armor, though the
    drawbacks of it are noticeable too. Too much guard may be overkill and it
    may be better to stick to medium or light armor in some cases.

    They control what the enemy can do by using Provoke and Threatening Aura.
    Provoke is a 1 turn Challenge for no AP cost, while threatening aura does
    cost 2 AP, but you automatically challenge everything around you. Challenge
    makes enemies provoke attacks of opportunity when they hit anybody except
    you, so you do need to keep in melee range of the enemies. Challenging Aura
    is especially good when you have other melee fighters that are squishy next
    to you. A berserker will greatly appreciate being hard to target.

    To help with being a threat with your attacks of opportunity, the controlled
    opportunities key ability gives you a small bonus to them. Thanks to it,
    guardians are more free to ignore focus and power and focus on defensive
    stats.

    Hold the line lets a guardian convert AP to RP at a good rate, at the cost
    of some mana. In a long fight, frequent use of this will let you keep your
    RP until you really need it.

    Last Stand is an ability that should only be used when you know you're going
    to face many attacks during the upcoming round. The RP cost is heavy, but it
    can easily be RP efficient. You don't need to use mana on this for it to be
    worth it, but it's worth considering if you are likely to face a bunch of
    heavy attacks.
