    Priests belong to a religion and utilize the mystery of divine power to

    The priest has access to several healing and support abilities.

    Holy Light is a heal that doesn't heal as much as Cure Touch does, but it
    costs less AP and most importantly, has greatly increased range. Where the
    acolyte has to play close to their allies and is at risk of provoking
    attacks of opportunity to heal, the priest doesn't have that issue. Out of
    combat, Cure Touch is still better for healing.

    The Secret Art: Resurrect is an emergency heal that can only be used when an
    ally has already gone down. Note how it sets the targets HP to 0 before
    healing. This makes it have great synergy with demons or other abilities
    that allow a person to fight at full strength when below 0 HP. They can keep
    going until they reach heavy negative HP before they go down, after which
    you can bring them back up.

    Sacrament is a free buff that you will most likely want to apply to your
    strongest physical striker at the start of combat. Turning the weapon into
    holy damage can also be very helpful against certain enemies.

    Anathema is powerful debuff that lets your allies to greatly increased
    damage for 1 hit. It relies on a save instead of an attack roll, making it
    good against dodgy enemies, but less effective against enemies with high
    toughness. Because all the damage is added up, it can be good against high
    armor enemies if you manage to land it, but most high guard enemies will
    also have high toughness. It also has a noticeable mana cost, so be mindful
    of how much you use it.
