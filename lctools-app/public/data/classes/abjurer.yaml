    Every initiate mage learns early on that the first fundamental of magic is
    defense. But for Abjurers, this lesson became their mantra. These Mages took
    their masters' teachings to heart and mastered the art of defensive magic.

    Abjurers are incredibly durable, and they don't just keep that strength to
    themselves—they can extend it to their allies, making everyone around them
    tougher in battle. Their focus is unmatched, allowing them to control space
    and protect others, even without relying on weapons.

    Despite their power, Abjurers are often underestimated. But when the heat of
    battle comes, they prove their worth, showing remarkable resilience under
    fire. It's this unshakeable defense that makes them indispensable in the
    chaos of war.

    Abjurer's are frontline spellcasters that oftentimes don't wear armor. To
    help with the durability, you have Mana Shield. Mana Shield gives you a
    small amount of temporary HP every turn. It's good for reducing a small
    amount of damage every turn, but will not protect from a large burst turn.

    If you expect to take a lot of damage, you can however use Empower Mana
    Shield. This lets you trade mana for temporary HP is an efficient way,
    however it only lasts for a short time so the timing is crucial.

    Mana Shield also lets you cast spells while engaged by enemies if they are
    challenged by you, which can be accomplished by the Spell Challenge key
    ability. AoE spells can be used to inflict Challenge on many enemies, though
    they won't apply it if they are dodged or fully blocked. Single target
    spells will always apply it however.

    To protect your allies and disrupt enemies that go for them, you have Arcane
    Pull. Arcane Pull is effective in keeping your backline safe from melee
    enemies, but it can be useless if there's not enough distance between you
    and your allies.

    Finally, Arcane Barrier II is a simple upgrade on the normal arcane barrier,
    letting you add your guard to the guard of the barrier.

    Positioning and choosing how and who to Challenge is key for an Abjurer.
    Once enemies are upon you, you may find it hard to safely apply Spell
    Challenge if not done in advance.

        You create a Magical Barrier that absorbs damage until it breaks. The
        barrier has HP equal to 8 + your Focus. The barrier has a Guard of 0 +
        your guard and any damage it takes is subtracted from the barrier’s HP.
        When the barrier breaks, any remaining damage is subtracted from your
        HP. The barrier otherwise lasts until the start of your next turn or
        until you take any action other than the Block action. If using the
        Block action while the barrier is active, the guard of the barrier also
        increases. This spell does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
