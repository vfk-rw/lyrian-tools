    Marksman is a single-target ranged powerhouse.  They rain heavy damage onto
    the enemy from afar and can be devastating if not stopped.
  guide: >-
    Marksman gain Status Assessment II, which in addition to showing HP also
    informs you of damage type strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge on what to
    use against enemies can be very important and this should be used
    frequently.

    Blast Away is a self peeling tool that knocks the enemy back on a failed
    save, letting you safely move away from the target afterwards.

    Prone Cover is another form of defense that lets you drop prone as a
    reaction. It gives the prone keyword to your ranged attacks and basic
    reactions, so you aren't left completely vulnerable while on the floor. You
    will have to spend AP to stand up again if you need to move, so it's not
    something you want to always immediately use.

    Consistent Shot combined the accuracy of a precise attack with the damage of
    a heavy attack. Primarily used when you want a high chance of dealing good
    damage against a target that still has RP remaining.

    Perfect Shot can do a lot of damage, but is reliant on your teammates to
    keep enemies within your line of sight for long enough. If your target
    breaks line of sight, the ability is wasted. To keep your options the most
    open, it is best to start your perfect shot by spending 2 AP as the last
    action on your turn. Now if you can't finish it, you will have only wasted 2
    AP instead of 4.
