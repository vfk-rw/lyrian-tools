  description: "Legends have it that Fayto Zhelti was the first true adventurer, a spirited young girl from a humble town in the Kingdom of Alpinum. \_Her Father was an explorer and Fayto dreamed of following in his footsteps.\nYet, as childhood began to fade away, a painful realization crawled within her heart: \_the incredibly physical feats of strength her father effortlessly performed always lay just beyond grasp. \_No amount of blood, sweat or tears could overcome the anguish of her physical reality. \_She watched her younger brothers surpass her in strength, joining their father on this expeditions she yearned for. \_Loneliness began to infect her heart that ached for adventure, but fate had cruelly denied her that path.\nStill she persisted, even in her pain... tirelessly striking the same tree day after day for years.\nHumans barely had the lifespan to master the arcane arts—which at the time were incredibly complex without shortcuts. \_Her Mother, an arcane practitioner, taught her daughter the methods of utilizing magic for mundane tasks: \_heating water kettles and stirring up a gentle whirlpool to do laundry. \_While practicing these humble homecrafts, Fayto remembered that feeling, the tingling surge that ran through her limbs.\nOne day, as she swung her dulled blade against that ancient tree, she poured every ounce of her yearning and willpower into her strike. \_The familiar surge ran through her as the explosive energy flooded her body, exactly as it had done alongside her Mother. \_In a thunderous crash, the mighty tree toppled.\nFrom that day forward, she pursued that elusive feeling. \_She trained relentlessly until she mastered the art of \"internal magic\" which would be known later as ki. \_Soon after that she joined her father's adventures at last, growing and developing until she embarked on her own journeys, making a name for herself wherever she went \"Fayto, the female adventurer.\"\nTo this day, adventurers still practice the skills Fayto Zhelti perfected long ago—a martial art born of determination and control of ones self, leveling the playing field for all who practice it. \_Following Fayto's example, Adventurers continue to train—leaping to extraordinary heights, molding mana to extend their reach, projecting their aura like iron... all while maintaining perfect composure. \_ Although the ancient martial art remains nameless, its teaches are diligently passed down to every aspiring adventurer, serving as a solid foundation for future development."

    The adventurer is a generalist class that has a bit of everything. One of
    the main draws of the adventurer is their options in picking their
    proficiencies, being the only tier 1 class that can choose a specialized
    weapon and heavy armor.

    Power Jump is an anti-air tool that lets you hit enemies in the air even if
    you only have melee weapons. It is even better if you can fly, as you can
    use power jump as a cheap way to gain altitude.

    Mana Razor gives you increased range on your attacks. If you're using a
    melee weapon with this, you'll need to be aware that turning your attacks
    into ranged attacks does mean you'll provoke attacks of opportunity. It may
    also disable the use of abilities with a range of “Melee Weapon Range”

    Steel Aura is a defensive tool that can be very powerful when attacked by a
    large group of grunts. With 3 additional guard, you will most likely take
    only 1 damage from light attacks from those enemies, though you'll still
    need to be wary of heavy attacks.

    Your Secret Art: Efficient Spirit Control is a simple mana reduction
    ability. If you do not have any other secret arts yet, then don't be afraid
    to use this whenever you would spend 2 or more mana on something.
