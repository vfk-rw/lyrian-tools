    The battlemaster is an expert in all weapons. If you find a good weapon,
    whether its an artifice, relic or even a divine arms, you will be able to
    use it to its maximum effect.

    You also don't need to worry about being unable to use certains attack with
    your new weapon due to the Unconventional Weapon ability. It has the
    potential for silly combos, such as using Iai while a greataxe.

    Being a master of battle, they posses ways to punish both Dodge and Guard
    focused characters. Skillful blow has lock-on to make it good against high
    agility where as Mordschlag's guard crush allows it to punish heavily
    armored enemies.

    Disarming Attack is their last ability and it can give them the edge in a
    duel against most martial enemies. If they forgot to bring a spare weapon,
    the disarm all but disables them for a turn.
