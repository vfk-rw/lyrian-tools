    Bards are the storytellers, entertainers, and actors of the world, hailing
    from all sorts of disciplines. Whether they're performing in a bustling
    tavern for a handful of tips or captivating a crowd in the town square,
    Bards bring life and joy wherever they go. They're the ones who immortalize
    the tales of adventuring parties, ensuring that no deed, whether noble or
    notorious, goes unheard.

    In a party, Bards play a crucial role by inspiring their allies to achieve
    greatness. With their music, they can lift spirits and hype up their
    companions, turning the tide of battle with a well-timed tune.

    The bard is a support class primarily focused around their Inspiring Song
    and Dirge of Despair. Inspiring Song gives every ally a 1d4 bonus to a roll
    once per round. It may not seem much, but it can be used to push a barely
    missed attack into hitting. Dirge of Despair is the opposite, affecting
    enemies instead. Due to allowing a save, it's a bit less reliable but a lot
    of fights may have more enemies than allies on the battlefield. Because both
    of these are songs and cannot be used at the same time, the bard has to
    choose which one they want to use. In general, Inspiring Song is more
    offensive while Dirge of Despair is a more defensive song.

    Their other support ability is Siren Song. It also cannot be used with the
    other two songs, but it can be a powerful CC against grunts. Because they
    spend the AP on their turn, their movement provokes attacks of opportunities
    and even if they are broken free, their spent AP remains lost.

    Their last combat ability is Shatter, which is a good follow up after luring
    enemies closer with Siren Song. The AP cost makes it usable even when
    keeping up Inspiring Song or Dirge of Despair as well.

        All allies within range (including yourself) may add 1d4 to a single
        roll they make until the start of your next turn. They may choose to add
        this after seeing the roll, but before knowing the result. At the start
        of your next turn and every turn thereafter, you may spend 1 AP to
        continue this performance, granting all allies within range the benefit
        once again.

        All enemies within range must make a save against your Potency or become
        affected by this Song. While affected, you may subtract 1d4 from a
        single roll they make until the start of your next turn. You may choose
        to add this after seeing the roll, but before knowing the result. At the
        start of your next turn and every turn thereafter, you may spend 1 AP to
        continue this performance. Enemies that successfully made their save, do
        not have to save again against this continued performance, but those who
        were affected continue to be affected.

        All enemies in range must make a save against your Potency. If they
        fail, they must spend AP on their next turn to move closer to you using
        the most direct path possible. If this path leads them through an
        obviously harmful hazard such as off a cliff, they are no longer
        affected by this ability. Otherwise, this ability lasts until they are
        within 5ft of you or until they take damage. While playing this Song,
        you can take no other actions. Taking any other action cancels the Song,
        immediately freeing all enemies from its effects. A creature can only be
        affected by this ability once per encounter.
