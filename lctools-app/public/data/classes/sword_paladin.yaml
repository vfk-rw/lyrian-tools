  description: >-
    Paladins are powerful warriors who receive their powers from their god.
    Sword paladins are fearless juggernauts from whom escape is nearly
    impossible.
  guide: >-
    The sword paladin is the more aggressive counterpart of the shield paladin.

    They specialize in hunting down their enemies by limiting their escape
    options. Mark of Justice slows down an enemy to the same level as a basic
    human. Very useful against Fae, Cats and rogue-ish characters. It also opens
    an enemy up to other abilities.

    Justice Blade can only be used against an enemy marked by Mark of Justice.
    It trades 1 AP cost in 1 for mana, which is a fair trade.

    When an enemy is low enough, Divine Smite can finish them off automatically
    dealing max damage with full pierce. If the enemy is not low enough, this
    ability still gets used but without the extra benefits so be aware of that.
    The enemy can also still dodge it, but it's good for finishing grunt type
    enemies.

        You mark a single enemy, inflicting Mark of Justice on them.


        A marked enemy’s movement speed is reduced to 20ft. Abilities that allow
        for movement cannot move the target for more than 20ft per use. Secret
        Arts and Climax Arts are not affected by this.


        You can only have a single enemy marked by this at the same time. It
        lasts until the end of the encounter. Does not work on vehicles.
