  guide: >-
    The windbringer is a wind based support that focuses on movement.

    They start the battle by giving their allies Tailwind, which increases their
    initiative and boosts their movement speed. This is especially useful when
    you start far away from the enemy and have many melee focused fighters in
    the party.

    If you need even more movement speed, you can activate Gale-Wind Aura. 20ft
    movement speed increase is a big boost and since your allies keep it after
    leaving the aura, they can cross great distances in a single turn.

    Headwind instead hampers enemy. You need to be somewhat close to an enemy
    for it to take effect, but it's an otherwise unavoidable slow. Once you and
    your allies have engaged the front most enemy, Headwind can be used to deny
    their allies a chance to help.

    Fly gives flying to yourself or an ally. The mana cost and upkeep makes this
    not something you can use continuously in a fight. Instead, grant allies
    small bursts of Fly to increase their movement and allow them to go up to
    hard to reach places.

        You project an Aura around yourself that increases the movement speed of
        allies within 60ft of you by 20ft. An ally that starts their movement in
        the Aura, keeps the Speed increase for that move even if they leave the
        aura.

        Upkeep:

        You must spend 1 AP at the start of each turn or the aura fades.

        You or the creature you touch gains controlled Flight, Hover and their
        movement speed is doubled while flying. If they take damage while flying
        higher than 5ft above the ground, their altitude drops by 20ft. If this
        would reduce their altitude to the point where they touch the ground,
        they become rooted and cannot fly again until the end of their next
        turn. If the attack that reduced your HP came from an airborne creature
        other than yourself, you do not lose altitude.
