    Fighters come from many backgrounds. They can be adventurers, soldiers or
    even just travelers who've decided to master the arts of combat. They wield
    weapons with expert skill, making them the backbone of any adventuring
    party.

    What sets them apart from ordinary soldiers is their ability to perceive and
    control mana within their bodies. This keen understanding gives them an
    edgeâ€”allowing them to move at high speeds and deliver powerful blows.
    Fighters are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and welcome
    allies.
  guide: "Fighters are versatile front liners that are able to defend against attacks effectively while also exerting pressure on the enemy.\_ A good fighter is expected to draw the enemy to them and to create space for the rest of their allies to unleash their full potential.\nCharge can be used to gain position in a fight without sacrificing attack. When moving in in the first round of a combat, you normally have to sacrifice attacks for the movement. Charge helps mitigate this, allowing the fighter to take point and still do damage.\nSlam is only a small knockback, but the AP cost of the attack is low and it has no other cost. It can be used to create space for an ally to safely escape, but a fighter can also use it at the end of their attack sequence. This way the target will need to spend 1 AP on movement again to get in range, lowering their attacks.\nDefensive Flexibility gives high RP economy, but it requires a bit of thinking ahead. It has to be used after you take one of the two basic reactions, and youll have to predict what your opponent will do next or force them to do suboptimal attacks. In long fights, consider what attacks you can safely tank without the use of RP to allow for more defensive flexibility uses in the future. Every RP you can spend that leads into defensive flexibility is effectively doubled.\nPower Strike is an attack that can deal a lot of damage, but is not very mana-efficient. It should almost always only be used against a target with no RP left. Fighters themselves don't have anything else that uses mana, so it's worth using for new characters. As you unlock more classes and get other abilities that use mana, Power Strike will probably not see much use anymore."
