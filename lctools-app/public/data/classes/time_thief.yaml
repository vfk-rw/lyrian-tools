  guide: >-
    The time thief is a utility class that manipulates their own time to gain
    advantages.

    With Shatter Time, you can act multiple times in a turn. This can let you
    act after teammates when needed, act when an enemy has moved closer to you
    or enemies have positioned for an AoE or several other things. It doesn't
    let you use an ability multiple times in a round though.

    Start Dash is a free movement, but it can only be used as the first action
    on your turn. This movement does provoke attacks of opportunity and you
    can't disengage or feint before it, so you may want to evasive maneuver
    before your turn begins if you plan to use it while engaged in melee.

    Steal Time gives you a small boost to your initiative while lowering that of
    enemy. This may let your allies potentially act before the enemy does on
    subsequent turns.

    Secret Art: Rewind lets you do stupid things without being punished for it.
    You can potentially hit into enemy counters to see what happens, run past
    suspicious hallways that may be trapped, attempt dangerous jumps across a
    cliff. If the result is bad, you can simply rewind time and either try again
    or do something else entirely.

        For this encounter you may act during different parts of a round. When
        you end your turn with AP remaining, you may choose to act immediately
        after another creature ends their turn.


        You do not regain AP or RP and these extra actions are not considered
        turns. You may take these extra actions multiple times during a round,
        provided you have AP remaining.
