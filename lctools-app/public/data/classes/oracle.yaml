        You designate a point that you can see within range, creating a magical
        ward at that point.  If you focus you can shift your perception to that
        ward and see and hear everything within line of the sight of that ward
        in a 30ft radius.  The ward can persist as long as you want over any
        distance, but you can only have one instance of Scry active at a time.


        The ward is invisible and inaudible, but can be detected through magical
        means.
