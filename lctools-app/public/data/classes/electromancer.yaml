  guide: 'Electromancers excel in fighting against enemies in water. Their superconductor
    ability applies two powerful keywords all lightning attacks for free. This applies
    even to attacks made with channeling weapons, not just the Electromancer abilities.

    Zap is an ability with a high chance to apply static. Static is the main debuff
    of the electromancer and what gives them the controller status. It does not damage
    the person who has it, but it forces them to position carefully to not hit their
    allies with it. Your allies are immune to the effect, so you don''t need to worry
    about the enemies hitting them with your static. Static is most effective if combined
    with roots, such as a netting flask or against enemies already engaged in melee
    combat, where moving to an isolated spot becomes more difficult.

    Bolting is a long range strike with a small benefit of potentially ignoring cover.
    The nature of the attack means it cannot be used indoors however. When not using
    it as a snipe attack, it''s most useful for being a Heavy attack that also applies
    Static.

    Forked Lightning is their only way to apply static without using mana. It requires
    there to be two targets, but static is useless without at least two targets anyway.
    The static value is lower than on the other attacks is lower to compensate for
    this lack of mana cost.

    Chain Lightning can decimate entire groups, provided that their RP has been burned
    beforehand and you don''t get unlucky with rolls. Only use it when at least two
    people have 0 RP or otherwise cannot react to your attack, otherwise it''s not
    worth the cost.'
