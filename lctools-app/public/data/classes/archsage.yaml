    The Sage is a class that specializes in augmenting the magical abilities of
    themselves. They are highly skilled in the use of magic enhancement spells
    and techniques, able to boost the power and effectiveness of other magic
    used by themselves.
  guide: >-
    The archsage brings more utility to the table, further augmenting spells
    they might have from other classes.

    Persistent spell adds another turn to the duration of a buff or debuff. Most
    of these have a short duration to begin with, so this can double the
    duration in a lot of cases.

    Battle Cast can be used when pressured by a melee enemy to cast spells
    without the risk of being attacked. It has a mana cost, so sometimes it may
    be better to simply retreat.

    If the archsage has mana, they can have powerful turns with the use of
    Presence of Mind. Reducing the ap cost by 2 is effectively the same as
    getting 2 AP, allowing for a potential 6 AP turn as long as mana lasts.

    To help with their mana issues, they have clearcasting. It is hard to find a
    better use of your encounter start ability than reducing the mana cost by 2.

    Finally, they have their Secret Art: Ultimate Spell. It works on AoE spells
    as well as single target ones and by turning it into true damage you ignore
    guard as well as damage resistances.
