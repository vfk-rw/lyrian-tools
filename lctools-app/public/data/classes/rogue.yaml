    Rogues are the shadowy denizens of the underworld, using subterfuge and
    cunning to outsmart their enemies. They know how to create confusion and
    chaos, slipping in for the perfect strike when the moment is just right. A
    Rogue’s greatest strength lies in understanding their own weaknesses. They
    never fight fair, always looking to tip the scales in their favor.

    You’ll find Rogues lurking in the dark corners of Lyr’s cities, where they
    navigate the underbelly with ease. But they’re not just criminals or
    street-level operatives. Many are recruited by official agencies, prized for
    their abilities in gathering information and conducting espionage. Their
    unique skill set also makes them invaluable members of adventuring parties,
    where their knack for stealth and strategy can turn the tide in any
    situation.

    Rogues thrive in the shadows, always one step ahead, always ready to seize
    the advantage.
  guide: "Rogues are high-mobility Strikers that specialize in weaving through the enemy lines, finding opportune targets and attacking them for high damage.\_ Feint, Evasive Maneuver and Movement Burst allow Rogues to take advantage of battlefield positioning without putting themselves into too much risk.\nFeint is a cheaper disengage that only works against a single target. It competes with evasive maneuver for escaping an enemy's attack range, but it has another upside to it. Because the target cannot make any attacks of opportunity against you, you could fire a ranged weapon in someone's face without risk.\nEvasive Maneuver is both an offensive and defensive tool. It can be used as a reaction to an enemy attacking you in melee, which forces them to move up if they wish to keep attacking you. This takes an AP and may provoke attacks of opportunity from your allies. The AP they were about to spend on the initial attack is refunded however and they may choose to swap targets. As a rogue, keep this is in mind if you don't have a dedicated tank in your party. It can also be used to position more aggressively to do a full attack turn. When used on your own turn, you don't even need to spend RP for it and can just use mana instead.\nMovement burst is their last mobility tool. The mana cost is high for what it gives, but the ability to move 100ft in 1 AP should not be underestimated. Whether it's for chasing someone or escaping, a rogue with movement burst is almost impossible to keep up with.\nFor offense, they have Sneak Attack. It has a noticeable mana cost, but trick attacks cost double the RP to react to. This means that grunts generally cannot react to it and even heroic creatures have to make a serious decision whether it's worth spending 2 RP against 1 attack.\nFinally, devastating strike is the attack that shines when someone's RP has been exhausted. Easy to use against grunts, but it will take some time for it to be usable against heroic enemies. Still, once you can use it it's just guaranteed, pure damage."
