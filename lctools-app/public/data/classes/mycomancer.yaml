    Mycomancers are powerful mages that harness the power of fungi to heal
    allies and destroy enemies. They try to understand death through mycology.
  guide: >-
    Mycomancers are a unique healer that relies on dealing damage to heal their
    allies. The only target they can heal is their Spore Symbiote.

    Once it is placed, you can use Saprophytic Bolt to heal your target. Grunts
    may react to it even if its a light attack, so burning their RP first may be
    advised so you don't waste it.

    Destroying Angel is a bigger heal and also comes with the benefit of
    instantly killing the target when used against grunts. It is not worth using
    against non-grunts however.

    Poison Spore is the last ability that can center around the spore symbiote.
    It can be used as a zoning tool of sorts, but be aware that your allies are
    not immune to the poison. One of the better uses is placing it around
    yourself or the symbiote if they are a more vulnerable target and using the
    spore as a deterrent to any assassin type enemies that might threaten the
    backline.

    Amoxicillin is a simple disease removal spell. The cast time makes it
    unusable in battle and you are required to identify the disease first, but
    it's a free removal once you do.

    As a mycomancer, it is recommended you heal early rather than late. Your
    healing can be unreliable and you don't want your allies to drop low, only
    for you to miss a crucial a heal and watch them go down.
