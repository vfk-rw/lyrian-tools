    The Duelist is a highly skilled fighter who excels in one-on-one combat.
    They are agile and quick on their feet, using their speed and finesse to
    outmaneuver their opponents and deliver precise, deadly strikes.
  guide: >-
    The duelist, like the fencer it builds on, is a 1v1 expert and off-tank on
    the battlefield. With deflect missiles, they gain some defense against
    ranged attacks.

    Riposte II is a more defensive version of the original riposte. Where the
    fencer traded the RP they saved from the Parry ability into damage, with
    Riposte II the duelist can dish out heavy attacks while sitting on all their
    RP still. It does cost mana, so it's nothing something that should be used
    after every Parry.

    Duelist Blow is a powerful tool in 1v1s, but since the benefit disappears
    when forced to use RP against other targets it may be hard to use in fights
    against multiple enemies unless you can find isolated those 1v1s.

    Forward Momentum is a simple and cheap ability that helps with that. It's
    best used with light attacks if the target still has RP remaining. A few
    attacks and the duelist can fight the target without interruptions.

    The Climax Art: Endless Waltz has the potential for a ton of attacks. It's
    especially strong against enemies out of RP, against who it may repeat until
    they are dead. Against grunts, it can still be powerful although less
    consistent. The first attack would remove their RP, while the second would
    deal damage. Of course, bad rolls can happen and the ability may end early.
