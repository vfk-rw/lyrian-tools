  guide: >-
    A colossus wants to use heavy weapons and Titan's Grip means that there is
    very little reason not to do so. They can use Mighty Leap get into range of
    an enemy and disrupt all enemies around the target, allowing the Colossus to
    engage into groups of enemies without severe risk. You can also jump to an
    empty spot if your goal is just to land an AoE unbalanced debuff.

    Double Slam is two hit combo of which every hit can inflict a debuff on the
    enemy. You can combo it after apply Unbalanced with mighty leap for a double
    chance to knock someone prone.

    Two Sword Crush is a powerful ability that lets you push past the guard of
    an enemy. Slam and Double Slam both only apply their effects on damage and
    are light attack, making an enemy likely to Block against it. If their guard
    isn't super high, you can then use Two Sword Crush to do more damage than
    their Block and apply the effect.

    Climax Art: Titan's Blade is a powerful AoE attack that will annihilate
    people that cannot avoid the initial strike. Can be used as a finisher, but
    also an opening move to immediately burn some RP from enemies if they line
    up for you.
