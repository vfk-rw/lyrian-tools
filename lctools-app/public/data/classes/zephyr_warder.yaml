    The Zephyr Warder specializes in ranged combat, helping both allies hit
    targets and preventing enemy archers from hitting.

    Wind Infusion can be cast on every ally over the course of a battle and
    gives them not only an evasion bonus against ranged attacks, but also damage
    resistance against wind attacks. Worth using immediately when facing those
    types of enemies.

    Wind Shield completely shuts down an enemy ranged attack, granting your ally
    such a huge bonus along with removing the lock-on and sure hit that the
    attack is sure to miss.

    Wind Wall has to be cast in advance, but it can cover a wide chokepoint and
    removes all keywords that lets them ignore Dodge or Block. The range
    decrease can also matter a lot, especially if enemies are only using light
    ranged weapons. The mana cost isn't too bad either.

    Wind-Empowered Aim buffs all your (heroic) ranged allies, giving a decent
    bonus to their accuracy rolls. Worth using if you have a lot of ranged
    attackers in your party or if you get into a shootout. With this buffs and
    all the anti-ranged buffs you have, you're sure to win a shooting battle.

        You surround the target in protective winds, changing their typing to
        Wind II. As a Wind II type, they take regular damage from all other
        elements, but only half damage from attacks with the Wind keyword.


        While the ward lasts, they gain a +2 bonus to their Evasion against
        ranged weapon attacks.


        The ward lasts until the end of the encounter or until their type is
        overwritten by a more powerful type.

        You create a wall of wind that is 30ft long, 5ft wide and 10ft high that
        slows down all ranged weapon attacks passing through it, treating them
        as having only half the normal range. This wall must be a straight line.
        These attacks also lose the Lock On, Sure Hit, Half Pierce, Guard Crush
        and Full Pierce keywords. In addition, the targets of those attacks are
        treated as having +2 Evasion and +1 Guard. Any Spells that are
        considered attacks (those that require an accuracy roll against a person
        that isnâ€™t using the Block reaction) that pass through the wall also
        suffer this penalty.

        You project an Aura around yourself that empowers the ranged attacks of
        your allies. When a heroic ally within 20ft of you makes a ranged
        attack, they may add 1d4 to the accuracy roll.

        Upkeep:

        You must spend 1 AP at the start of each turn or the Aura fades.
