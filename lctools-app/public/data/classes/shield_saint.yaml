  description: >-
    The sworn shieldbrother or sister of a Sword Saint. Like its twin saint, the
    Shield Saint originally hails from Kirara where it fights together with
    their chosen partner.

    The Shield Saint is trained in defensive techniques whose purpose is to
    allow for their partner to focus purely on offense while the Shield Saint
    absorbs the hits. At first these techniques were merely physical, but over
    time the nature has evolved into a more spiritual connection. The bond
    between a Shield Saint and their partner links their very souls together and
    neither can be bonded again until one of them passes away. Because of this,
    the partner a Shield Saint chooses is very important and in Kirara most
    pairs are selected based on compatibility at an early age. It is not
    uncommon for a Sword Saint and Shield Saint pair to be romantically involved
    with each other.

    As a Shield Saint, your primary goal is to protect your soulmate from harm.

    Your main tool for doing so is Faithful Shield, which lets you turn AP into
    free RP for the purpose of keeping your soulmate safe. Shelter still has a
    range restriction, so this works best if your soulmate is also a melee
    character.

    Quick Assist combines several feature of Bodyguard into one and adds some
    offense on top of it. Keep in mind the range is rather short and like with
    Faithful Shield, your life is easier with a melee soulmate as you are more
    likely to get the mana cost reduction.

    The secret art Dynamic Duo combines defense with offense. You Challenge all
    enemies and can use the bodyguard's At your side to teleport across the
    battlefield to threaten enemies you didn't before. Where normally your
    attacks might be a bit weak, because your soulmate is making them it will
    punish enemies ignoring your Challenge that much harder. It also has a low
    mana and AP cost, so you can use it pretty much every fight.

    Finally, Lifesense is a utility tool that can be used to keep track of the
    status of your soulmate should you split up. It has no mana cost, so you can
    keep it up indefinitely if you want to.
