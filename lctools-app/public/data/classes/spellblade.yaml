    The spellblade is a melee class that relies on its versatility of its weapon
    enchantments to gain an edge in battle.

    Imbue Weapon allows you to always do damage that an enemy is weak to if
    you're aware of it. Greater Imbue Weapon is similar, paying 1 mana cost for
    +1 power bonus. Most of the time, if you are planning to stick with 1
    enchantment, you will want to use the Greater version. In fights where you
    are constantly swapping your enchantment, it may be more worth to stick with
    the normal version.

    Draw Elements is what allows the spellblade to pick whatever element they
    want. Outside of elemental damage bonuses, this is mostly relevant for
    Elemental Strike.

    Elemental Strike is a light attack that can apply a whole variety of
    effects, based on what your weapon is currently enchanted with. Which one of
    these is the most effective depends heavily on the situation.

    Spellstrike lets you use attack magic despite being in melee combat. It is
    effectively the same as casting a spell without provoking attacks of
    opportunity, but since it is applied through your weapon it does benefit
    from Greater Imbue Weapon or similar weapon related buffs.

        You choose an ability with the Spell keyword that you can use. You make
        a melee attack against a target in range for the same AP and mana as the
        Spell. Your attack does the damage and applies all the effects that the
        chosen Spell does, but does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. The
        requirements for applying these effects remain the same. Only works with
        Spells that are attacks.
