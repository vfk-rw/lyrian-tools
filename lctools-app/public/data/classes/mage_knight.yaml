    First fielded by Westria during the growing advent of the Church of Light
    and cavalry’s importance on the battlefield, the Mage Knight brought both
    magical support and healing to the highly mobile battlefront. While
    originally simply an order of priest-knights, Mage Knights would eventually
    grow to encompass all forms of magical casting. Whether it was raining down
    spells or utilizing their unique training to heal mount and rider both, the
    Mage Knight could turn the tide of a battle with their mere presence. And
    while there were countless stories throughout the ages of holy knights
    bringing men back from the brink of death, there were none as debated as the
    story of Dame Madeline Benoit and Sir Owain Morgan.

    As told and accepted by Westrian historians, Dame Madeline Benoit was a
    human Mage Knight without equal. Gentle and nurturing to her allies and able
    to bring her enemies low with figurative hellfire, she held a near saintly
    presence in the Church of Light. Debates would still sometimes crop up among
    the clergy as to her suitability as a Saint but her history was both ill
    documented and controversial, depending on who was asked. There was no
    dispute of her actual existence as her name was recorded as a Holy Knight of
    Kari, but there was a much debated feat in her history: Sir Owain Morgan and
    the proliferation of Great Knights into Westria’s military.

    While there were many versions of the tale, the most accepted one in Westria
    followed a series of reasonably set in stone facts. During the many border
    incursions from Northi as it tried to wrest control of the Nuren Plains from
    their ancestral owners, it was said that Dame Madeline Benoit helped
    devastate a Northi skirmishing force. Not only was she instrumental in
    capturing many of the Northi knights, she graciously tended to their wounds
    with a special focus on Sir Owain Morgan. The dogfolk Great Knight had taken
    the brunt of the Westrian counterattack as he shielded his men and required
    significantly more care than the others. In fact, he traveled back to
    Westria for further treatment while his men were released back to Northi. It
    was said that, in his gratitude, he volunteered the skills of the Great
    Knight and allowed Westrian artisans to study his and his mount’s armor. And
    while there was debate on the validity of that tale for the origin of the
    proliferation of Great Knights into the Westrian military, they paled in
    comparison to the vicious arguments that revolved around the love story
    between Dame Madeline and Sir Owain.

    The most commonly accepted telling of the great love between Madeline and
    Owain was that of star crossed lovers fighting destiny and the world to be
    together. What started as simple care for a wounded knight became tender
    affection as the months of Owain’s recovery ran on. Some accounts painted a
    picture of desperate, forbidden love with various forces working to keep
    them apart. Secret marriages, hidden lineages, and fantastical courtly
    intrigue plagued the romance novel market with few authors making any
    attempts to disguise their protagonists. The reality of it was much simpler
    and all the sweeter for it.

    Neither Madeline or Owain had the heart to return to the constant fighting
    between their two countries and retired from their respective militaries.
    The legend among the Benoit household was that the pair had a private
    wedding in the garden of Madeline’s childhood home and then departed for
    destinations unknown. The rumor was that they spent time as traveling
    knights, wandering Lyr and helping those in need. And while those actions
    had never definitively been attributed to Dame Madeline and Sir Owain, what
    couldn’t be denied was when they both turned back up in solid historical
    record.

    They would found Morgan Ranch in what would later become Dacquoise, near the
    future site of the city of Madeline. It was there that the retired knights,
    happily married for an unclear amount of time, had begun taking on students
    and ranch hands to teach the art of horsemanship, knighthood, and magic.
    While the ranch itself did not last into modern times, the house itself was
    maintained and the legacy of chivalry was upheld by the descendants of those
    students. Collectively, and informally, they called themselves the Knights
    of Morgan and dedicated themselves to helping those in need whenever and
    wherever they were found.

    The mage knight is a mounted healer that specializes in aiding other mounted
    combatants.

    Cavalry heal is a heal that heals both the rider and mount for a mana cost
    that is only slightly higher than a normal heal, making is pretty efficient.
    It is important to note that unlike a lot of other of the mounted class
    abilities, both spells of the mage knight can be used while dismounted.

    The other heal in question is Rescue, which is a mid range teleport spells
    that pulls an ally next to you. This immediately puts them in range for a
    healing ability. Unlike most teleport abilities, this pulls both mount and
    rider. Can also be used offensively to pull a slower ally closer to the
    enemy.

    Another way the mage knight can heal allies is by using Mounted Casting. You
    can ride past an ally and use Mounted Casting to heal them, then keep riding
    on to safety. If your way is blocked, you can also use Canter thanks to your
    key ability.

    Finally, your Secret Art: Ride of the Valkyrie requires some setup and
    positioning from your allies but it's an efficient heal if you can hit your
    entire party with it. Can also be combined with trample, but be careful as
    your trample getting blocked may prevent further movement and healing.
