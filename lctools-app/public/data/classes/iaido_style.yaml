    The art of Iai came from the Island of Kirara, a sword style utilizing
    Kiraran blades.  The Youkai were known for their highly lethal speed and
    technique in preference over raw power.  Iaidoka are quite rare, students of
    elusive Kiraran Masters who only train two students at a time.

    Masters of the Iaido style typically start the battle in one of two ways:
    They open with an Iai strike or wait for the enemy to strike, then counter
    with Uke Nagashi. Iaido centers around Iaijutsu and the sheathed state.
    Their most important abilities are locked behind this sheathed state and
    unless you fulfill conditions, its a once per battle thing.

    Iai Strike is a powerful attack that not only has lock-on, it's also only 1
    AP. Unless you are using a weapon other than a katana and mixing weapon
    fighting styles, this will most likely be your first action in combat.
    Because using it loses the sheathed state, it can not be used again unless
    you use Kiri-tsuke.

    Kiri-tsuke is a heavy attack with the benefit of resetting your sheathed
    state when you score a kill with it. Depending on the battle, this may be an
    easy or hard thing to do, but you should always look for the opportunity for
    the reset.

    Chiburi Noto is used at the end of the encounter and buffs you for your next
    one by maximizing your Iai strike damage. The benefit of this can be good,
    but if you are low on HP or mana it may be wise to use one of the basic
    options instead.

    Uke Nagashi is a powerful counter move that has the condition that you must
    still be in the sheathed state. Because making any attack with a katana
    removes the sheathed state, this means you can not attack before using Uke
    Nagashi, unless you use a different weapon. This is a valid option. You can
    choose to attack with a normal sword, then drop it and prepare for your
    counter. If you'd rather only use a katana and still want to use this, then
    you can instead play very aggressive with your positioning. Use all your AP
    to move up, then when the enemy wants to attack you, unleash the counter.
    You can also choose to delay and hope the enemy moves up and attacks you.
