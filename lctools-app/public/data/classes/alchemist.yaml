  guide: 'Alchemist is a crafting class that can use the consumables they craft to
    great effect. With Light Work you can craft tons of items at the same time, though
    you still have to pay material costs as normal. As you go through a lot of items,
    being able to double what you craft in 1 point is still valuable.

    Throw Potion lets you function as a healer for a party. Your healing will be fairly
    AP efficient, but it can be dangerous to rely on an alchemist healer as the person
    receiving the potion has to pay the mana cost. In a party where other people may
    want to use their mana for their own abilities, it may be impossible to heal as
    the fight drags on.

    Doctor Jekyll lets you or an ally drink a potion or elixir when the combat start.
    In most cases this will be an elixir, allowing you to get a boost without having
    to spend an action on it.

    Quickdraw Alchemy lets you take out an alchemy item at any time, even when it''s
    not your turn. Most of the time this property will not come into play, as you
    can''t use it when it''s not your turn yet, but you could prepare a flask that
    an ally can take off your hands when it is their turn. Of course, you will most
    likely just want to use it to not have to spend your AP to draw them before using
    them yourself.'
