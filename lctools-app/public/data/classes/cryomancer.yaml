  description: 'Masters of frost, the Cryomancers weave the raw, chilling power of
    ice into an art form. Theirs is a domain of control, using their wintry gifts
    not for sheer damage, but to manipulate the battlefield and dictate the flow of
    combat.


    Cryomancers thrive in battlefield control where their icy enchantments can wreak
    the most havoc. With a wave of their hand, they can transform the ground to ice,
    halting an enemy advane, or encase foes in blocks of solid frost, taking them
    out of the fight completely. Their chilling spells can slow even the most agile
    opponent, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.


    Don''t let their cold demeanor fool you - beneath the icy exterior lies a burning
    resolve. To be a Cryomancer is to understand that the battlefield is a canvas,
    and with the power of frost at their fingertips, they are the artists, painting
    a portrait of control and chaos in equal measure.'
  guide: 'The combination of Icicle Nail, Sheet Ice and Glacial wall are a hat-trick
    of battlefield control, both creating cover, halting enemy advances and slowing
    front line enemy units.  As a pure controller, Sheet Ice can be used freely and
    at minimal cost to block chokepoints or to funnel enemies.  It can also be used
    to hinder the movement of units by casting it into an enemy.


    Glacial wall can create cover from nothing, quickly subverting a strategic advantage
    the enemy might have or bolstering your own.


    Lastly in a pinch, the Cyromancer can devastate low level enemies with Frost Coffin,
    immediately eliminating a threat from the battlefield and also creating cover
    for your team.'
