  guide: >-
    The bodyguard is focused around protecting a single target. You can choose
    who this target is with VIP Protection. They are well-suited to escort and
    protection missions, but even in normal ones they synergize well with
    squishy melee allies. Since they automatically get hit and can't react when
    using the redirect part of VIP Protection, having high Toughness and wearing
    armor is recommended.

    With Temporary Protection, the bodyguard can pay a heavy mana cost to
    protect another ally. It should only be used in emergencies, but using it on
    a low health ally can keep them in the fight without them having to play
    super defensive.

    Shelter is a more limited, but powerful version of the re-direct of the key
    ability. Heavy Attacks will do a lot of damage if you take them without
    reacting, so Shelter is best saved for those attacks.

    At your side helps you with positioning. It can save your VIP target when
    they do something stupid or if they get forcefully moved, but it can also be
    used offensively to teleport next to them when they charge ahead.

    Vengeance is a cheaper heavy attack that can be used if your VIP target was
    attacked. If the condition is met, there's rarely a reason not to use it. It
    becomes even more powerful if your VIP target is below 0 HP, though you
    obviously do not want that situation to happen to begin with.
