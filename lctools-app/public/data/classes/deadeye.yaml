    The deadeye is a ranged striker with some minor control and utility. Status
    Assessment III is similar to the previous version, but it no longer has the
    quick keyword meaning it can be used without worrying that it increases the
    cost of other abilities.

    Aimed Shot is a simple attack meant to punish enemies that rely on dodge.

    Disarming Shot is a powerful tool that can be used to disarm enemies for a
    long range. Disarming melee enemies may seem like the obvious choice, but
    many ranged enemies will not carry a spare ranged weapon. Disarming them
    will most likely lead to them being unable to act for the turn.

    Countershot is another tool the Deadeye has to show it is the superior
    ranged attacker. It is not guaranteed, but it can assist allies and defend
    yourself against opposing ranged attacks.

    Secret Art: Perfect Repetition is not the easiest secret art to use. It has
    the upside of having no mana cost and relatively low AP cost, but if you
    roll badly the attack is wasted. On the other hand, a good roll almost
    ensures a guaranteed hit every round unless the target takes cover. It is
    more reliable when the enemy has no RP, but don't be afraid to throw it out
    early and go for a gamble. It's worth the risk.
