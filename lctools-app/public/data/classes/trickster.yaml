    The trickster is a support class that provides weird and unique benefits to
    the team.

    Assign Decoy gives the unique ability to taunt an enemy by an ally that
    would normally have no access to it. It can be used to temporarily make an
    enemy switch targets or if in a party without a tank, can be used to set up
    a sort of tank rotation.

    Swap gives the Trickster high control over the battlefield. They can walk
    near the edge of a clif, then swap an enemy next to it. Forcefully group
    enemies to setup for a teammates AoE attack. Swap an ally out of danger and
    much more. Extremely versatile and due to its Rapid nature and low cost can
    easily be spammed.

    Misdirected Blow has some conditions for it to be good, but it can turn
    enemies against each other. Most effective on tricksters with high agility,
    as it can let you evade blows that will hit most other targets.

    The Secret Art Grand Theater allows the trickster to set up a magnificent
    performance. They can force enemies to hit each other and give allies free
    actions. They just need to be careful, because even their allies are forced
    to attack and careless use may force them to attack an ally.

    Their perfect mimicry has little combat potential, but it allows a trickster
    to truly infiltrate a place and sow chaos.
