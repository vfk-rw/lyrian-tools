  guide: 'The tactician is a support class that has a lot of mobility options. Stratagem:
    Lightning not only gives all your allies extra initiative, it also lets them move
    once for free. This is very useful if your part consists of primarily melee fighters.

    Order: Retreat is primarily meant to be a defensive tool, pulling an injured ally
    out of a bad situation. It can also be used offensively. You can move up towards
    the enemy and then Order: Retreat them closer to you and the enemy.

    Tag Rotation is useful in chokepoints. Let your first ally make attacks, then
    tag rotate to let your second melee fighter make their attacks. It can also be
    used when a weaker ally is about to be attacked to swap positions with a tank.

    Take Cover! is used in long range shootoffs. Turning your low cover into high
    cover will give your allies an edge in ranged battles.

    Attack in Detail is used against boss type enemies. The primary benefit is the
    +1 damage all your allies get against the target. It''s more useful if your allies
    use light attacks, due to more attacks gaining a benefit from the +1. It also
    is more useful the more allies you have. When you only have 2 allies with you,
    the benefit of this ability might not be high enough vs just firing an attack
    yourself.'
