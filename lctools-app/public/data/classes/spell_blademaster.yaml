        You may enchant your weapon with an element. Your weapon now deals the
        chosen element’s damage instead of its normal damage.

        If you are not holding the enchanted weapon at the start of your turn,
        your weapon loses this benefit.

        The weapon gains a +1 Power bonus to attacks until the end of the
        encounter.

        Until the end of the encounter, you enchant your weapon with every
        single element. When using Elemental Strike or Elemental Sweep, you may
        choose which effect you want regardless of the damage type your attack
        deals. When you deal damage, you apply the damage type that would deal
        the most damage.

        In addition, your weapon gains a +1 Power bonus until the end of the
        encounter. If it already had a +1 Power bonus through an enchantment,
        this bonus is instead increased to +2.

        If you are not holding the enchanted weapon at the start of your turn,
        your weapon loses this benefit.
