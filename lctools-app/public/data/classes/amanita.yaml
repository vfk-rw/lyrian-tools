  description: "Amanita’s are expert Mycomancer’s that weave life and death hand in hand.\_ Blessed healers to their allies and terrifying killers to their enemies, they were feared ever since the first Fae Amanita’s appeared amongst the ranks of Sylvan’s army.\_ Amanita’s often wear mushroom caps on their head with spotted designs to signify their rank.\_ The spores that reside within all Amanita’s blood also grants them considerable resilience against poison."
  guide: "Amanita’s expand on the Healer and Striker hybrid of the Mycomancer, specializing in supporting tanks while busting enemy tanks.\_ Vital Drain and Hyphal Force are excellent tools for overcoming armor, while also keeping allies healthy.\_ Spore burst is useful in a pinch when caught out of position.\_ The Amanita also has the terrifying ability of keeping allies up while downed, giving them the ability to continue fighting.\_ However, make sure to remind your allies that they are in risk of dying due to being able to fight at negative HP, as reaching negative maximum HP can kill a character."

        You fill your target with mycelium from your spore symbiote, allowing
        them to act fully despite being Downed. Removing Spore Symbiote from the
        target cancels this effect. This effect ends at the start of your next
        turn unless you spend 1 mana to continue the effect.

        HP amount.
