    Vampire Lords drift through the pages of history like living
    shadows—accursed souls chained to undeath by the very forces that empower
    them. In dimly lit taverns, alongside whispered tales of Dragons and other
    legendary horrors, travelers speak of eerie encounters and boast of glimpses
    caught at the corner of a moonlit eye. Whether these sightings are truth or
    fancy, one thing is certain: the name Vampire Lord stirs fear and
    fascination in equal measure.

    Unlike lesser Vampires who lose themselves to bloodlust or despair, Vampire
    Lords have embraced their curse, searching its depths to forge a power all
    their own. They understand their twisted existence at a level few can rival,
    developing uncanny resistances to the sun’s harsh sting and other infamous
    banes of their kind. Yet what truly sets them apart is their mastery over
    the delicate threads connecting the Arcane, Faith, and Astra—allowing them
    to skirt the borders of Higher Order Magic. Their Vampiric Domination arises
    from this warped interplay of energies, a distant, corrupted echo of the
    Mystic Eye once claimed by the fabled Aseria clan of Sorthen.

    That unholy gift grants them the power to ensnare weaker minds, exerting a
    terrible control that echoes across dark corridors and silent chambers. Even
    so, few mortals have battled a Vampire Lord and returned with their lives,
    for these lords of night prefer to move in secrecy. Outwardly, they can seem
    disarmingly regal—yet beneath that lies a being forever dancing on the
    razor’s edge between life and the endless darkness. Should you cross paths
    with a Vampire Lord, know this—their secrets run deeper than any mortal can
    fathom, and their hunger, while tempered, still seeks knowledge and power in
    their cursed existence.

    A lot of the vampire lord builds on what the vampire does.

    Feeding Frenzy gives you a free bite whenever you down someone while in
    Blood Frenzy, allowing you to regain 1 mana. If fighting a lot of grunts you
    can reliably kill, this can effectively half the upkeep cost of Blood
    Frenzy.

    Vampiric Domination is a stronger version of the fascination. You can choose
    to have a permanent servant, or you can use it more situationally such as to
    dominate enemies to extract information from them, dominate people of import
    to have them aid you. They will know what you did afterwards, so it's
    recommended not to stay around when you're done with them.

    Bloodbolt is a simple ranged option that can be lacking as a normal vampire.
    You can invest HP into it for extra damage, but this might not be worth
    doing in most cases unless you plan to Blood Frenzy shortly after.

    Your Secret Art: Bloody Ritual is a powerful AoE ability. The damage is
    guaranteed unless the tether is broken and if you can hit enough enemies
    with the ability, you can even refund the mana you spent on it. Due to the
    range on the ability and the slowing effect, it can be a powerful zoning
    tool even if enemies do manage to break it.

        You mentally dominate the target. The target immediately considers you
        their master and they will serve you like a loyal servant. You may
        command them and they will obey most commands. Any command that is
        obviously suicidal or completely goes against their nature (for example:
        telling a servant to jump off a cliff or to kill their own child) will
        end the domination prematurely. This effect lasts until dispelled, they
        die or until you use Vampiric Domination on another target.

        After the effect ends, the target will remember everything it was forced
        to do while it was your servant and it cannot be affected by Vampiric
        Domination again for a year.

        You create a blood tether to all enemies within range, causing them to
        be Slowed. The tether lasts until the start of your next turn or until
        they move out of the range of this ability.

        At the start of your next turn, the tethers explode, dealing Heavy
        damage to all tethered enemies as it sucks the life energy from them.
        For every enemy dealt damage with this ability, you recover 1 Mana or 5
        HP (your choice). If an enemy dies while under the effect of the tether
        but before it explodes, you also gain this regeneration effect.
