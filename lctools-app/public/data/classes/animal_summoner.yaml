      description: >-
        Your animal summoned through the Summon Animal ability gains the ability
        to act independently. It acts at initiative 0, though you may still
        control its action. A summon with Independent Action starts with 2 AP
        and 1 RP and may use those as normal. If they have an ability that costs
        mana, then you still have to pay that mana cost.

        While it is under the effects of Independent Action, you cannot command
        your summon through the use of your own AP.

        A summon targeted by this ability takes up 2 slots towards the summon
        limit. If this would put you past your limit, you cannot use this
        ability.

        The summon may take basic actions as if it had 2 AP to spend.

        In addition, if your summon is under the effects of Independent Action,
        it gains Bestial Command until the end of the encounter, it dies or you
        cancel it for 0 AP. While Bestial Command lasts, its maximum AP and AP
        recovery are increased by 2 while your AP recovery is lowered by 2.
